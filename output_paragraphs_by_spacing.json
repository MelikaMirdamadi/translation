There was the homeowner who needed urgent assistance from her insurance company after a natural disaster destroyed her family’s home; the retiree not sure how to access the benefits he worked for all of his life; the scared mother of a small child who accidentally ingested a household product; the manager struggling to get her computer working before the biggest presentation of her young career. (I mention these examples in Chapter 1.) It’s really quite amazing. When it’s set up well, we as customers can—right now— reach someone who cares and who has the expertise and resources to help. It’s been almost 25 years since the first edition of this book was introduced. The response surpassed our highest expectations, and we were excited and grateful to see the book reach so many corners of the world. The book, now in its fourth edition, has evolved significantly since that first edition. Social media, smartphones, artificial intelligence (AI), new mobile- and Internet-based services—to name just a few of the developments in the years since—have changed the game. And yet, for all the exciting developments, I’m a bit surprised at how little the core management principles have changed. So…if you’ve read any of the first three editions, you’ll see some things that are familiar. This was an extensive update and rewrite, but we didn’t try to change the unchangeable—the principles that are tried and true. You can trust the continuity in those core areas that will never change. You’ll also find much that’s new: managing omnichannel, new sections on customer access strategies, empowering employees, using metrics, customer advocacy, the impact of AI, and (above all) the strategic role of contact centers. My career began underneath contact centers. One of my first jobs was with an interconnect company that supplied telecommunications and data systems. I was the lowest-ranking person on the team, and my primary responsibility was to install cabling. This was often underneath floors, through tight, dark spaces with spider webs, scalding hot utility pipes, and creatures that would scurry just out of flashlight range. There’s a popular expression of starting one’s career on the “ground floor.” Much of the time, I just wanted to get back up to the ground floor! But I had some great mentors and, with their help and encouragement, began to get excited about the communications era and how it’s rapidly changing our world."

    "paragraph": "A t the beating heart of every contact center are the human-to-human connections that are forged every day—tens of thousands of times over the course of months and years. Management methods, processes, and technologies (which you will learn about in the chapters that follow) are enablers. But the essence of the contact center lies elsewhere—in one person conversing with and connecting with another. In my consulting work over three decades, it’s been my privilege to sit next to hundreds of customer service agents, across many industries, as they’ve made these connections in the course of their daily work. Sure, there are the routine interactions that neither the customer nor the agent will remember for very long, but I have witnessed many calls for help that were full of emotion and significance. There was the homeowner who needed urgent assistance from her insurance company after a natural disaster destroyed her family’s home; the retiree not sure how to access the benefits he worked for all of his life; the scared mother of a small child who accidentally ingested a household product; the manager struggling to get her computer working before the biggest presentation of her young career; the person newly diagnosed with a frightening medical condition whose outreach was the first step in the treatment journey. If you think about it, it’s amazing. When it’s set up well, we can—right now—reach someone who cares and who has the expertise and resources to help. There were many developments that had to happen to enable these connections to take place. So … just for a moment … let’s go back and see how it all got started. The Birth of Instant Communication If you’re in Washington D.C. and have the opportunity, consider a visit to Hotel Monaco. The ultra-high ceilings and classical architecture are amazing. The building was the city’s original post office and, more significantly, where inventor Samuel B. Morse opened and operated the first public telegraph office. Telegraph enabled the transmission of Morse code, a signaling system of short and long"

    "paragraph": "beeps. (You may have seen telegraph systems in historical movies.) Messages that took ships or land carriers days or weeks to deliver could now be relayed in seconds. You get a sense of the awe that this new technology inspired in the words of the first transmission Morse sent on May 24, 1844: “What hath God wrought?” I believe Morse and others who were there that day got a glimpse into an astonishing future —instant communication across vast distances. I can only imagine their wonderment had they lived to see the communication capabilities we now carry in the palms of our hands. The immediacy of telegraph helped inspire other advancements in communication. The telephone, invented in 1876, quickly became part of everyday life. And it had a big advantage over telegraph: it could be used by anyone, with no special training required. Its ease of use led to rapid growth—a parallel we see today in smartphones. Immediate communication became the new normal. French artist Pierre Puvis de Chavannes wrote, “By the wondrous agency of electricity, speech flashes through space and, swift as lightning, bearing tidings of good and evil.” Historian John Brooks described the impact of the telephone on life in the first decade of the 1900s this way: “In city and country alike, the telephone was creating a new habit of mind—a habit of tenseness and alertness, of demanding and expecting immediate results, whether in business, love or other forms of social interaction.” The First Call Centers In the early 1900s, fast-growing demand in transportation and communication services was creating new challenges. Whether it was roads, rails, runways or relay circuits, the pressure was on to get capacity in place. And business leaders struggled to understand how these new capabilities would change customer behavior. As the subscriber base grew, telephone companies were contending with a perplexing resource-planning problem. Human operators were required to establish connections for customers, as automated “central offices” hadn’t yet been invented. The big question was, how many operators were needed? Too few, and long waits would be unacceptable to customers. But too many would be inefficient and drive up costs. Further complicating the issue, the calls came in randomly, driven by the myriad of motivations individuals had for placing calls. It was one thing to get physical infrastructure in place. But it was a different challenge altogether to get ever-changing calling demand and patterns accurately matched up with the correct number of human operators—day in and day out. Service that was slow or unavailable was unacceptable to a public that had thoroughly embraced this new means of communication. In the years that followed, many bright people would grapple with these and related resource management challenges. One of the first was A.K. Erlang, an engineer with the Copenhagen Telephone Company in Denmark. In 1917, he developed the formula now called Erlang C, which is widel"

Today’s Contact Centers Today—over a century later—even as speed and innovation have reached levels previously unimaginable, there are unmistakable similarities in the challenges and opportunities communications capabilities create. We see significant breakthroughs, from social networks that connect us in new and powerful ways to multimedia capabilities that can instantly put us face-to- face. What Brookes described in the early 1900s is as true as ever: communications capabilities have us “demanding and expecting immediate results.” And if you manage a modern contact center, there is a familiar ring to the demands the early telephone switchboards faced. Accurately matching resources to customer needs in a dynamic, always-changing environment is an ever-present challenge. Forecasting the workload, getting the right people and other resources in place at the right times, meeting customer expectations— these continue to be key objectives and competitive necessities. However, the value contact centers create has evolved by leaps and bounds. Today’s contact centers handle work that is, in a very real sense, already escalated—the complex issues not immediately resolved through search, online resources, self-service capabilities, or other means. They enable customers to quickly reach the help they need. And they empower the organization to listen, engage, and learn. When fully leveraged, contact centers capture insight that enables the organization to improve products, services, and processes—and the overall customer experience. They bring order to what is otherwise an enormous challenge in serving customers and understanding their evolving needs and wants."

    "paragraph": "A Definition for Contact Center Management The International Customer Management Institute (ICMI) defines contact center management as “the art of having the right number of properly skilled people and supporting resources in place at the right times to handle an accurately forecasted workload, at service level and with quality.” This definition can be boiled down to two major objectives: 1) get the right resources in place at the right times, and 2) do the right things. Let’s take a look at each. Contact center management is the art of having the right number of properly skilled people and supporting resources in place at the right times to handle an accurately forecasted workload, at service level and with quality. The Right Resources in Place at the Right Times To deliver consistently high levels of service, you need a strategy that defines how you will interact with customers. We’ll look at the importance of developing and maintaining an effective “customer access strategy” in Chapter 2. Then, you will need a systematic planning and management process, which can be summarized in nine steps:"
  },
  {
    "page": 18,
    "paragraph": "1. CHOOSE SERVICE LEVEL AND RESPONSE TIME OBJECTIVES. These fundamental objectives set parameters for the two major types of interactions: those that must be handled right away (requiring a service level objective) and those that can be handled at a later time (requiring a response time objective). We’ll explore these objectives in Chapter 4. 2. COLLECT DATA. Today’s contact center systems are important sources of planning data. But much of the information you need comes from beyond the contact center: what marketing is doing, how customer preferences are changing, competitive activity that may have an impact on workload, developments in the economy, and so on. We’ll discuss this step in Chapter 5. 3. FORECAST THE WORKLOAD. A good forecast accurately predicts the number and nature of contacts and expected handling times for future time periods. Forecasts should encompass all channels—phone, email, chat, social media, video, text, and others. Your plans should also account for any related work that will require contact center resources. We’ll discuss forecasting in Chapter 6. 4. CALCULATE BASE STAFF. Most contact centers use the formula Erlang C or variations of it to calculate staffing requirements. But capabilities such as skills-based routing and complex network environments present variables that may require computer simulation and modeling. We’ll explore these issues in Chapter 7. 5. CALCULATE SYSTEM RESOURCES. Staffing and system resources are inextricably"

    "paragraph": "linked and must be considered together. We will summarize this step in Chapter 7. 6. CALCULATE SHRINKAGE. Once you’ve estimated staffing requirements for customer workloads, you’ve also got to be realistic about other demands on time—breaks, training, work not directly part of handling customer interactions, absenteeism, and others. We’ll take a look at this step in Chapter 8. 7. ORGANIZE SCHEDULES. Schedules are plans that specify who needs to be where and when. They should result in getting the right people in the right places at the right times. We will discuss scheduling in Chapter 8. 8. CALCULATE COSTS. This step projects costs for the resources required to meet service and quality objectives. We’ll cover budget issues throughout Parts Two, Three and Four. 9. REPEAT FOR HIGHER AND LOWER LEVELS OF SERVICE. Preparing budgets around different levels of service provides an understanding of cost trade-offs, which is of great value in budgeting decisions. We will discuss this step in Chapter 10. Without exception, the best-managed contact centers do a good job of resource planning and management. They have established processes that are collaborative and accurate. But of course, meeting service level objectives is just an enabler—a ticket to proceed. The real value comes from what you do with interactions once the connections are made. Doing the Right Things—Creating Value Doing the right things means creating value for your customers and organization. Contact centers have the potential to create value on three levels: LEVEL 1: EFFICIENCY. Because contact centers combine or “pool” resources—people, information, and technology—they can deliver services that require the involvement of agents very efficiently. Effective forecasting, scheduling, and real-time management contribute to these inherent efficiencies. We’ll look at these subjects in Parts Two and Three. LEVEL 2: CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND LOYALTY. Research reveals a powerful connection between high levels of customer satisfaction and business results—market share, word of mouth, profitability, and others. Customers can easily share experiences through ratings and (as we all know) social media—any interaction can impact the reputation of the organization and its products and services."

    "page": 20,
    "paragraph": "LEVEL 3: STRATEGIC VALUE. In the course of handling interactions, the contact center can become a powerful source of insight (from customers, agents, and operational data), enabling the broader organization to improve products, services, and the overall customer experience. This involves virtually every other functional area. Some organizations have discovered the true strategic potential of their contact center, and others are just beginning this discovery process. Creating more value often requires you to rethink priorities, goals and objectives, metrics, job roles, processes, how you use technologies, and other aspects of your approach. Most importantly, it involves working closely with the rest of the organization (see figure)—creating a great customer experience is a team sport! These subjects will be covered throughout Parts Four and Five."

The technologies powering today’s always-on world, along with fast-evolving customer expectations, are dramatically changing the nature of how products and services are provided and supported. Many leaders are wondering where the trends and developments are taking us. Will the fundamentals of contact center management still apply? Short answer: If you’ve established the right fundamentals, then yes! Let’s say you want to interact with your customers through social media—Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, or others. The same planning and management steps apply. You’ll set service level objectives, forecast the work, establish schedules, develop quality criteria, and leverage what you learn from customer interactions to improve products and services. How about communicating with customers face-to-face through video? This channel is becoming more common in customer service. And who knows, virtual reality may one day enable customers to “beam” themselves to a chair across the desk of one of your employees. So how will that change things? You’ll need to look and dress the part for the image you want your organization to convey. But the management approach is the same. Forecast, schedule, establish quality processes, and continue to innovate and improve. You get the gist. The essentials of getting the right people and supporting resources in place at the right times and doing the right things will never become obsolete. Tried and true principles of effective"

    "paragraph": "contact center management will be as important as ever. So, how is contact center management changing? An obvious answer is that there are new types of interactions all the time. Many of these interactions put multiple contact channels in play; for example, customers may initiate the service process through online search, use self- service, then move to a combination of phone, text, chat, or other channels that involve an agent. And as a rule, human interactions are becoming more complex as routine processes are automated or prevented altogether. Today’s contact centers handle work that is, in a very real sense, already escalated—the complex issues not immediately resolved through search, online resources, self-service capabilities, or other means. Channels will continue to proliferate—but it’s important to keep this trend in context. Contact centers have handled multiple channels for years. The concept of omnichannel burst onto the scene as technologies and management practices began integrating channels and enabling them to work together seamlessly. The term is beginning to fade somewhat as the principles of omnichannel become widespread and assumed. But successful customer experience leaders remain focused on creating services that customers find intuitive and easy to use. This is a work in progress as new capabilities, such as AI-driven technologies, become a deeper part of the mix. ✽✽✽ Skills and Knowledge Requirements ▪ Leadership and management ▪ Customer expectations and behavior ▪ Cultural aptitude ▪ Communication ▪ Queuing theory ▪ Quantitative analysis ▪ Workload forecasting ▪ Staffing and scheduling ▪ Managing variable workloads ▪ Project management ▪ Coaching and performance ▪ Employee engagement"

On the other hand, you might have thousands of employees working across multiple sites. In either case—or any point in-between—you need a plan to guide the direction and development of your contact center. In contact center terminology, a strategic plan is known as a customer access strategy. In this chapter, we’ll identify the customer expectations on which your strategy should be based. We’ll then turn to what a customer access strategy is, identify the components that make up an effective strategy, and look at some of the creative ways organizations are engaging with their customers. But before we explore those topics, let’s answer the most basic question: What is a contact center? What Is a Contact Center? A prerequisite to developing an effective strategy is to decide that you need a contact center —or perhaps acknowledge that you already have one! Let’s review what a contact center is and does, and identify characteristics that define all contact centers. ICMI defines contact center as: “a coordinated system of people, processes, technologies and strategies that provides access to information, resources and expertise, through appropriate channels of communication, enabling interactions that create value for the customer and organization.” Okay, there’s a bit to this definition. But there’s also a bit (actually a lot) to contact centers—much more than casual observers may know. It’s often easier to explain what a contact center does than to define it. And great examples are everywhere. Consider healthcare. In recent years, many hospital systems have launched contact centers. In their simplest form, they help patients reach the right department, doctor’s office, or patient room. However, the more advanced centers—the kind I’m referring to here—provide a wide range of services, including medical advice lines, billing and insurance issues, physician referrals, even information and registration on wellness classes. All through this one resource."

    "paragraph": "It’s often easier to explain what a contact center does than to define it. And great examples are everywhere. You can imagine the rationale these management teams think through before launch: Customers (patients) have thousands of questions a day. They contact different departments looking for answers, often reaching the wrong places. The employees in those areas don’t have the time, training, or know-how to handle many of the misdirected inquiries that they get. In many cases, those handling contacts aren’t sure where to send patients for the information they need, so they transfer them to other units or back to a main switchboard. This dance wastes countless hours and frustrates everyone, employees and customers alike. Then someone begins to ponder. “What if we had a better way to handle all of these issues? We could train qualified professionals and give them access to the information they need. We’ll hire nurses to address medical-related questions. And we’ll put in a system for documenting contacts and logging critical data. We’ll develop quality processes for coordinating with the rest of the institution and safeguarding information.” One day … voilà, a contact center is born! This whole sequence of events—beginning with someone envisioning a better way to serve customers—has played itself out many times in recent decades. All of today’s best contact centers started as an idea. Today, contact centers are part of every vertical sector of the economy, including commercial, government, and nonprofit. They can be found in organizations of all types, small and large. This discovery process can also happen within organizations that already have contact centers. For example, the marketing department may respond to customer service issues that show up in social media channels. But keeping up becomes increasingly difficult, and a constant distraction from other work. Service to customers becomes hit-or-miss. The wise among them get together with their colleagues in customer service and come up with a plan to enfold these interactions into the contact center. They’ll let go of the work but establish good cross-functional collaboration with the contact center to ensure customers are being served well. Characteristics of Contact Centers All contact centers, small or large, share some basic characteristics. These include: ▪ Interactions are handled by a group of employees, not a specific person. (In other words, customers reach out to a service, not an individual.) ▪ Agents are cross-trained to handle a variety of contact types. ▪ Customer contacts are distributed based on agent availability and/or specific skills required. ▪ Agents have access to information on the organization’s products, services, policies, and any other resources needed. ▪ Agents are empowered to make decisions and take actions for customers."

    "paragraph": "▪ Systems track information on the quantity and nature of contacts handled, service levels, customer information, and other aspects of service delivery. This data can be used for planning, as well as product and service improvements. Even today, there are some people managing contact centers who don’t know they are … well, managing a contact center. It’s a bit chaotic. Okay, very chaotic. But they and their teams do their best to manage variable workloads and meet customer needs. One fortunate day, they’ll run across a blog or be talking with a colleague. They will discover that contact center management is a profession. They may do some further digging and discover a bunch of resources that can help. They will find articles, conferences, and other professionals who also manage contact centers. They will realize—with great relief and excitement—they are not alone! If this describes you, and you’ve only recently discovered contact center management —welcome! What Should You Call Your Contact Center? Your Employees? While the term “call center” is still commonly used outside the industry and in mainstream publications, it has largely fallen out of favor with those in the profession. As organizations continue to transition centers once dominated by calls and email into omnichannel operations incorporating chat, text, video, social media, and other types of contacts, many feel that “contact center” (spelled “contact centre” in much of the English-speaking world) just makes more sense. And that is the term I use throughout this book. But you’ll find other variants, including: ▪ Customer care ▪ Support center ▪ Resource center ▪ Customer service center ▪ Customer experience team ▪ Sales and support ▪ Technical support ▪ Help desk ▪ Information line ▪ And others There are also terms specific to some industries, such as reservations center (travel), hotline (emergency services), and trading desk (financial services). And some organizations create their own terms, like the “Customer Loyalty Team” for online retailer Zappos, or “AppleCare” for the computer company."

    "paragraph": "Similarly, there are many terms for contact center employees: agents, customer service representatives (CSRs), customer care representatives, associates, consultants, engineers, and others. Some organizations refer to their contact center employees as customer advocates. (I like it!) My advice is to use terms that fit your organization’s personality. How you refer to your operation and employees can make a difference. These labels become part of your team’s brand —they influence how colleagues and customers see you. So go for something inspirational! Customer Expectations Contact centers are all about enabling organizations to meet customer expectations—to be there when needed and with the services needed. But wait … aren’t expectations always changing? Yes and no. Customer demands are constantly evolving because improvements in service reset their expectations at new levels. While customers initially appreciate good service, they quickly get used to and expect it. Additionally, the experiences customers have with any organization—not just yours or your competitors’—help shape their perceptions. So, organizations that are driving service innovations are upping the ante for all others. The good news is, zeroing in on customer expectations is not the hit-or-miss proposition it may appear to be. ICMI has researched this issue for nearly three decades and has found ten customer expectations that consistently emerge. ✽✽✽ Ten Key Customer Expectations (no specific order) 1. Be accessible 2. Treat me courteously 3. Be responsive to what I need and want 4. Do what needs to be done promptly 5. Provide well-trained and informed employees 6. Tell me what to expect 7. Meet your commitments and keep your promises 8. Do it right the first time 9. Follow up"

    "page": 28,
    "paragraph": "10. Be socially responsible and ethical ✽✽✽ The key is to keep tabs of what these expectations mean to customers. For example, there was a time when being accessible simply meant having a call center, a toll-free number, and reasonably well-trained agents. Today, there are many access alternatives, and customers expect to reach you easily and intuitively (they don’t want to think about channels). Customers expect service that is easy to use and consistent across all touchpoints. While courtesy used to refer primarily to the way agents interact with customers, the definition today is much more ingrained in systems and processes. Don’t make customers repeat the same information or reexplain the background of an existing service issue. Don’t transfer them around or place them on hold for too long. And put your contact information where customers can easily find it. Sure, it’s as important as ever that your agents are courteous—but there’s a lot more to it. Definitions of responsiveness and promptness are also evolving. As one example, email response times have gotten far better in recent years—from several days to a matter of hours in many organizations (see Chapter 4). In fact, some organizations are staffing for email like they do calls or chat and handling them as they arrive. Similarly, more organizations all the time are handling time-sensitive social media interactions as they occur. Another customer expectation is that the organization will staff the contact center with well- trained and knowledgeable agents. As a rule, contact centers are handling more complex issues, through more channels and from customers that come from increasingly diverse backgrounds. Robust self-service capabilities are handling a deeper range of issues, leaving your employees with the most complex interactions. Successful contact centers are rethinking and upgrading recruiting and hiring practices, the training they provide to agents and managers, and the tools and processes they put in place. Tell me what to expect. Meet your commitments and keep your promises. Do it right the first time. Follow up. These expectations are interrelated and require that people, processes, and technologies work together. The promises your organization or employees make must also be backed up by other departments. Customers live by the mantra “trust but verify”—they’ll trust your organization if you hold up your end of the bargain. Be socially responsible and ethical. Lapses, or even perceived lapses, in ethics or social responsibility quickly make the rounds with customers and your own employees. Ethics and responsibility are the concern of the entire organization, but as a hub of communication, the contact center is inherently involved. In short, anticipating customer expectations is essential to developing effective services. In fact, customer expectations ultimately define what good service means. Truly understanding your customers can help you stand out in an environment that evolv"

    "paragraph": "▪ Don’t guess at how you’re doing. Track customer perceptions through social media channels, during interactions with agents, and through surveys that provide input on how well you’re living up to their expectations. ▪ That said, remember the late Steve Jobs’ advice: customers don’t usually know what they want until you show it to them. If you want to differentiate through service, don’t just copy industry “best practices”—be bold and create services that are appropriate for your organization and brand. ▪ Finally, ensure that customer expectations form the context in which you develop your customer access strategy—the topic we’ll turn to next. Shaping Your Strategy At some point in developing customer services, the need for an overall plan becomes very obvious. So many decisions—do you add this channel, do you support that service, and many others—are interrelated. You need an effective strategy. Otherwise, you’ll be winging it—and wasting lots of time and resources. Vision I recommend beginning with your vision—where do you want to go? A customer service vision helps define the type of service you want your organization to deliver. A common mistake I see, and one you’ll want to avoid, is coming up with an overly- generalized vision or mission. For example, “we put customers first,” or “we deliver world-class service” are so generic and uninspiring that they really don’t help much in guiding decisions. Vision can be represented as a vision statement, a mission statement, a set of values, or some overarching principles or standards. I love outdoor equipment and services retailer REI’s mission, which also serves as its customer service vision: “We inspire, educate and outfit for a lifetime of outdoor adventure and stewardship.” What great direction this short statement provides, even to the newest employees! USAA, the highly-rated insurance and financial company, operates around four core values (which are really just four words): Service. Loyalty. Honesty. Integrity. Together, they are simple, clear, and inspiring. And they pack a punch because at USAA they discuss and include them in decisions every day. That makes a real difference. If your organization has a vision that is too generic or that doesn’t help guide those delivering service, you may want to create one that’s specific to your contact center. Just make sure it’s complementary, cautions consultant Todd Gladden, part of an ICMI team that advises organizations on their strategies. “Have a ‘line of sight’ linkage between the contact center’s vision and strategy and how they support the overall vision and strategy of the company. The tie- in should be clear—and will prevent conflicting agendas as tactics are implemented.”"

Come up with something that both inspires and recognizes the enormous potential of your organization and contact center. Components of a Customer Access Strategy A customer access strategy is “a framework—a set of standards, guidelines and processes— describing the means by which customers and the organization can interact and are enabled to access the information, services and expertise needed.” It is the overall plan—the blueprint—that guides the development of your contact center. A customer access strategy is a framework—a set of standards, guidelines, and processes—describing the means by which customers and the organization can interact and are enabled to access the information, services and expertise needed. As with an organization’s overall strategy, a customer access strategy can take many different forms. But effective plans cover, in one way or another, these essential components. CUSTOMERS: This part of your strategy should summarize how customers are segmented (e.g., by geography, volume of business, level of service purchased, unique requirements, or other characteristics) so that you can shape specific services that are just right. Customer segmentation typically comes from the organization’s marketing strategy. However, given the operational requirements of serving different customers appropriately, I’ve noticed that contact center managers are increasingly involved in this effort. CONTACT TYPES: This step identifies the major types of interactions that will occur (e.g., inquiries, orders, support). Think through how each type of interaction could improve customer loyalty and build value. For example, some you’ll work to eliminate (through improved products and services), some you’ll want to automate through self-service, and some will best be served with the involvement of an agent. ACCESS ALTERNATIVES: This step—where strategy really begins to hit home for contact centers—identifies all of the possible communication channels (phone, chat, email, social media, text, video, face-to-face, self-service, customer communities … the lot) along with corresponding telephone numbers, web addresses, email addresses, social media usernames, IVR menus, physical addresses, etc. Where more than one channel is involved in an interaction (say, when a customer begins in an app and has a conversation with an agent) define as many possible combinations as you can. HOURS OF OPERATION: This part of your strategy defines appropriate hours of operation. These can vary for different contact channels or types of interactions. Generally, self- service applications will always be available. Some agent-assisted services may be available 24/7, while others may have more limited hours. For example, customers can report emergencies such as downed power lines to their utility any time of day or night, with general customer service (billing"

Different objectives may be appropriate for different types of interactions, contact channels, and customer segments. ROUTING METHODOLOGY: This part of the plan covers how—by customer, type of interaction and access channel—each contact is going to be routed and distributed. While these terms have inbound connotations, this also applies to outbound; for example, when the organization originates the contact, through which agent group will the contact be made? PEOPLE/TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES REQUIRED: This step transitions from “getting the contact to the right place at the right time” to “doing the right things.” Which agents or systems will be required for each customer segment and contact type? INFORMATION REQUIRED: What information on customers, products, services, and policies will need to be accessible to agents and customers? What information should be captured during interactions? How will the organization meet applicable privacy or reporting requirements? ANALYSIS/IMPROVEMENT: This step defines how the information captured or created during contacts will be used to better understand customers and to improve products, services, and processes. You may also want to summarize major performance objectives and how the contact center’s value and contributions will be measured (see Chapter 12). GUIDELINES FOR DEPLOYING NEW SERVICES: Finally, your plan should outline a framework for deploying new services, including technology architecture (corporate standards and technology migration plans) and investment guidelines (priorities for operational and capital expenditures). This step should also describe who will keep the customer access strategy current as services evolve: who has overall responsibility, how often the plan will be updated, and who has ownership of individual components. What Does a Customer Access Strategy Look Like? Customer access strategies are like business plans in that some are well-documented and others exist only in pieces and in the heads of various managers. Too often, the latter is the case. But there are standout examples of plans that are effective and up-to-date. A mobile phone company that I have worked with has a well-organized customer access strategy, which lives on the organization’s private intranet. It consists of a cleanly designed home page, the centerpiece, which provides links to each of the individual components. The links access files (databases, documents, etc.) that make up the different parts of their plan, such as customer segments, access numbers and addresses, routing diagrams, agent groups, hours of operation, service level objectives (and so forth). There are also links within these areas that allow you to logically move to others—but the home page will always get you back to the main directory. The most impressive aspect of the plan is that it lists who is responsible for keeping the overall plan current, and the individuals wh"

Questions Your Customer Access Strategy Will Answer Your customer access strategy will be a guide that you can use to answer many important questions. For example: ▪ How should your contact center be organized (e.g., how agent groups should be structured)? ▪ If you add or improve integration of an access channel, what is the impact on other components and resources? ▪ What kinds of skills and knowledge will your agents, supervisors and managers need? How should your hiring and training practices support these requirements? ▪ What system capabilities best support your strategy? Do you have what you need in-house or will you need to build, buy, or contract for required technologies? ▪ What kind of processes best support your plans? Where should they be refined or restructured? ▪ Is it feasible or advisable to outsource some or all of your contact center services? (If so, the customer access strategy is still the responsibility of the client organization.) What capabilities must the outsourcer have to support your requirements? ▪ Can contact center strategy help shape the organization’s strategy (e.g., by helping to differentiate the organization’s services)? Are the organization’s overall strategy, contact center strategy, and the realities of budgets and resources in alignment? With new ways to communicate and connect emerging by the day, the sky is the limit! As you make decisions, keep your customers’ needs and perspectives front and center. Customers don’t think of contact channels or departments. You don’t hear a customer say, “I’m going to contact XYZ’s contact center.” They say, “I’m going to contact XYZ.” To them, the contact center is the company. The best managed organizations know this, and they cultivate strategies that enable their brands to shine through. ✽✽✽ \"Playbook\" at the University of California Does a customer access strategy sound like something that would be nice to have? Actually, it’s vital. Just ask anyone who’s part of the University of California’s Retirement Administration Service Center (UC RASC).

Ellen Lorenz, Director of UC RASC, shares, “The more we worked on our customer access strategy, the more excited we got about it. It has become a tool that all of us within the RASC use and reference. It gives the team a strategic view of why we do what we do—a view that doesn’t get lost in day-to-day activities.” Many RASC employees provided input into shaping the customer access strategy, which the team now refers to as the “Playbook.” The Playbook has brought many benefits: better focus on priorities; teams that are increasingly self-directed; and projects that come in on time and within budget. It even helps RASC employees envision and develop their careers. And the most exciting benefit? The University of California uses the RASC as an enticement to attract some of the best professors, doctors, researchers and specialized talent available in the global market. “Our customer access strategy has helped our contact center become a strategic asset,” says Lorenz. ✽✽✽ Make It Yours! What access channels should be opened up? What’s the nature of service you intend to provide? Beyond applying the sound management principles we’ll be looking at throughout the book, these decisions are yours to make. My overarching advice: Make your customer access strategy uniquely yours—do what’s best for your customers and your organization. Here are some examples of how customer access strategies are playing out: ▪ London-based Barclays bank offers video banking, allowing customers to chat face-to-face with a representative from their smart phone or tablet. The service is available 24/7, and offers support on a wide range of services. ▪ 1-800-Flowers (1800flowers.com) is the company name, phone number, primary URL, and (you guessed it) address for Twitter, Facebook, and other channels. ▪ Discover Card enables customers to reach agents through in-app messaging, among other channels. Unlike conventional chat, which requires customers to stay connected until a problem is resolved, customers can respond to agents when they choose without having to start over on an issue. ▪ Dyson puts its toll-free number and website address right on its vacuum cleaner handles— clearly visible to anyone who uses the appliance. ▪ Intuit’s Accounting Professional Division developed a vibrant customer community, easily accessible directly through their accounting software programs; users help each other with most questions, and contact center agents have become facilitators and problems solvers for issues requiring the company’s involvement. ▪ The National Cancer Institute in the U.S. uses Facebook Live Events to reach out to patients and their families with information and support."

    "paragraph": "▪ Square, Dell, and many other companies that provide involved technical support have embraced co-browse capabilities, which have boosted quality and customer satisfaction, while reducing handling times. ▪ Gucci, the luxury retailer based in Florence, Italy, is opening six contact centers in sites that include Florence, Shanghai, New York, and other regions, to (in the words of CEO Marco Bizzarri) give customers “a direct connection to the Gucci community that is seamless, always accessible, personalized experience.” You get the idea here—these are just some of many examples I could cite of strategies that came about thoughtfully. Observe the organizations you most enjoy doing business with, and you’ll notice the best deliver services in ways that meet customer needs while complementing their own brands and cultures. Given the many ways to interact, a smart practice is to create an easy-to-find online listing of access alternatives. Do a search on “how to contact [Schwab, KLM, Apple]” and you’ll see good examples of the primary ways to reach the organization. From landing pages that list contact alternatives, some organizations provide templates for entering product numbers, serial numbers or customer information that leads to more accurate routing and customized services. Studies show that when problems get serious, customers (yes, of all generations) overwhelmingly want to interact with a human. Companies that make their contact information hard to find (usually in an attempt to minimize costs) are asking for trouble. A search will usually pull up other sources—blogs, customer communities, and sites such as GetHuman.com— that provide tips for reaching the organization. These can include contact numbers, advice on navigating difficult menus or (when the company is perceived to be purposely hard to reach) direct contact numbers for executives or administrative offices. Here’s a final recommendation: Be sure to provide an acceptable basic level of service (through good resource planning, a topic of later chapters) across all of your access channels. The best plans go awry when customers get frustrated and begin intentionally selecting the wrong menu choices or using access alternatives for other services, just to reach a person. Clearly, developing an effective customer access strategy is not something you throw together during an afternoon team brainstorm (though that can certainly give the creative part a push!). It takes leadership, persistence, and participation from across the organization. But the payoffs are huge. From a customer’s perspective, a good strategy will result in simplified access, more consistent services, and a high degree of convenience. From the organization’s perspective, the benefits translate into better decisions, services that are more effective and efficient, and a dependable framework to guide developments. ✽✽✽ Points to Remember"

    "page": 38,
    "paragraph": "N ewcomers to contact centers are often surprised at how different they are compared with other departments or types of “office” work. “The workload is volatile.” “Timing is so critical.” “Things change so quickly!” Those who have never been in a contact center and see this dynamic for the first time—calls entering the queue, the back-and-forth of chat, social media messages lighting up screens, et al. —are often astounded at how fast-moving the environment is. Yep, the workload does change from moment to moment. And when customers don’t know how long the queue (their wait time) is, they become impatient much more quickly than in settings where they can see what’s going on. The vast majority of contact centers handle primarily “inbound” contacts—those initiated by customers. There are three major driving forces at work in any center that handles inbound workload: 1. Workload arrival—random, smooth, or peaked? 2. The queue—visible or invisible? 3. The seven factors of customer tolerance These driving forces help explain why the contact center environment is unique. Understanding them is necessary for making good decisions on everything from staffing and scheduling requirements to establishing the right performance objectives. Workload Arrival—Random, Smooth, or Peaked? The first driving force in contact centers is how workload arrives. If you’ve spent more than just a few minutes in a contact center, you’ve probably already discovered a dominant reality: contacts come in as they please. They certainly do not arrive in anything resembling an even, orderly flow."

And two, three, four more … Exactly when contacts arrive from moment to moment is the result of decisions made by customers who are motivated by myriad individual needs and conditions.

    "paragraph": "The figure illustrates two possible scenarios of how 50 customer contacts might arrive. The input for the chart came from a statistical table of random numbers. However, there is an important distinction between random contact arrival and predictable arrival patterns. Virtually all contact centers—even those of the more volatile type, such as emergency services—have distinctive patterns in customer contacts, which are usually detectable down to at least the half-hour timeframe. You can predict that you will get around 250 contacts next Tuesday between 11 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. What you can’t predict with any precision is how many of those contacts are going to arrive at 11:01, 11:02, 11:03, and so forth. Consider another example. If you manage an ice cream stand, you can (with some analysis and practice) predict the number of customers and sales based on month of year, day of week, and time of day. Saturday afternoons during warm months will be busy, but traffic will be light on mid-week autumn mornings. You can also predict the volume before and after promotions or"

    "paragraph": "events such as baseball games. But you wouldn’t be able to predict the minute-by-minute arrival of customers. There are several important implications to random workload arrival. First, staffing must be calculated by using either a queuing formula that takes random arrival into account or a computer simulation program that accurately models this phenomenon (see Chapter 7). Other approaches almost always lead to inaccurate staffing calculations. And unfortunately, it’s not just staffing that will be off. Because staffing affects the “load” your network and systems must carry, inaccurate staff predictions also lead to miscalculations of these other resources. Second, centers that handle inbound contacts operate in a “demand-chasing” environment. At any given time, there are either more contacts than staff to handle them or more staff than contacts to be handled. That means contact centers must pair good forecasting and staffing plans with effective real-time management (Chapter 11). You don’t want to overreact to normal ebb and flow in workload—but you need to be able to respond quickly if a serious resource mismatch is developing. Third, performance objectives and standards must take random workload arrival into account. For example, a goal of producing “N widgets per day” makes no sense in an environment where the workload arrives randomly (see Chapter 14). Unless the queue is always backed up and service is lousy, your agents will spend a portion of their day waiting for contacts to arrive. Smooth and Peaked Traffic In addition to random or “normal” traffic, there are two other general types of workload: “smooth” and “peaked.” Traffic engineers have assigned statistical “variance-to-mean” ratios to designate each type of traffic, but essentially, the patterns for each look like those in the figure, Three Types of Workload Arrival."

For example, a group of people may be assigned to make outbound calls (e.g., for surveys, sales initiatives, non-profit donations), one after another, for the duration of their shift. In that case, staffing requirements can be based on a units-of-output approach common in many manufacturing and service settings. Another type of contact arrival—peaked traffic—is a reality in some centers. Many of us use the term “peak” in a general sense when referring to contact center workload: What’s your peak time of year? Peak day of the week? Peak time of day? But the term “peaked traffic” specifically refers to a surge of traffic beyond random variation. It is a spike within a short period of time. Television and radio ads often generate peaked traffic. For example, QVC (part of Qurate Retail Group) gets a surge of contacts when new products are advertised on its home-shopping channel. Disaster relief and humanitarian organizations, such as the Red Cross and World Vision, get peaked traffic when their ads are aired, as do mobile phone providers when they send text messages to a large portion of their subscribers. Even email promotions sent in batches can generate an initial surge of contacts (as well as contacts that will arrive in subsequent hours and days). The (typically) large centers that handle peaked traffic can go from receiving zero to hundreds of contacts per minute, almost instantly. (Seeing this dynamic will immediately boost your heart rate!) It’s important to distinguish between random and peaked traffic. When retailers send out thousands of new catalogs by mail, they begin getting contacts (calls, chat, etc.) associated with the promotion. But that’s not peaked workload arrival. It’s random arrival, just at a much higher level than usual. Similarly, a utility that has a power outage will receive a lot of contacts until the problem is fixed. But other than the few minutes following the outage (which is a time of peaked traffic) those contacts will arrive randomly, although at a level much higher than usual. The key point to consider: if a surge of contacts lasts longer than 30 minutes, for staffing purposes it’s considered random workload arrival. Randomly Arriving Peaked Traffic Some centers experience workload arrival that is a hybrid between random and peaked traffic. Emergency service centers often get a surge of calls reporting the same traffic accident. A topic that trends in social media can quickly generate contacts. And in an unusual example, I was facilitating a seminar for a financial company one afternoon when their calls went through the roof—as it turns out, talk show host Oprah Winfrey had just interviewed a guest who encouraged viewers to negotiate interest rates with their credit card companies. These are examples of peaked traffic that show up without notice (as opposed to the kind you can predict, such as when you run a TV ad). Here’s the thing to remember: the distinction between random and peaked"

    "paragraph": "Given variations in the workload throughout the year, month, and day, contact center forecasts must be based on specific increments—not daily averages. Increments, also called intervals, are the smallest units of time reflected in reports and used for resource planning. Typical reporting increments include: 30 MINUTES. Thirty-minute increments are common because they provide an adequate level of detail and accuracy for many centers without burying them in unnecessary detail. 15 MINUTES. Large contact centers (e.g., those exceeding 100 agents in an agent group) pick up additional accuracy by planning around 15-minute increments. 60 MINUTES. Contact centers that handle long calls (e.g., when the average length of interactions exceeds 20 minutes) can establish report increments and staff calculations around hour increments. 10 MINUTES OR LESS. Peaked traffic—the kind you can anticipate and manage, such as a television ad—requires reports and staffing calculations at 5- or 10-minute increments. The principle here is to forecast and plan down to the smallest increment within which you can no longer detect patterns. For many, that is 30 minutes and that’s the increment I recommend for most contact centers. If you’re a large contact center (e.g., into the hundreds of agents), you'll pick up needed accuracy with 15-minute intervals. If you’re small (a dozen or fewer agents) or have long calls with average handling times that exceed 20 minutes, hour increments often work best. Building Understanding It’s important that others across your organization understand the nature of random workload arrival. And nothing helps more than seeing it firsthand. As customers, we’ve all experienced the fragile balance between resources and demand— expressways that ebb and flow, airports that struggle to stay on schedule as bad weather moves through, the immediate and pleasant impact on lines when a busy supermarket opens more checkout registers. But seeing this dynamic in a contact center is an eye-opening experience! Usually, colleagues from other areas will quickly grasp the importance of good cross- functional communication, keeping systems humming, and ensuring that the contact center has the staff and support it needs. More importantly, a deeper appreciation of randomly arriving workloads begins to take hold. This is not an assembly line or a stack of documents to process. You cannot slow it down or speed it up. You’ve got to be there as the workload arrives! (See the discussion, The Power of One, Chapter 9). The Queue—Visible or Invisible? The second driving force in contact centers is the queue—is it visible or invisible to customers? Queue comes from the word cue, a term from Old French that means “line of waiting people.” The term is common in everyday British English (less so in North America, where “line” is typical) and appears frequently in contact center terminology.

After all, handling every contact at once is about as practical as it would be for airlines to check in every passenger’s luggage at the same time. But an important difference between a contact center and the lines at an airline counter, grocery store or sports arena is that customers usually can’t see how long the queue is and the progress they are making."

As they move forward, the subsequent faces illustrate their progress. The final face reflects the fact that they “made it”—they are at the front of the line, hearing the sweet words, “How may I help you?” The second row of faces represents a setting where customers are unaware of the length of the queue they are entering. Ignorance is bliss, and expectations are initially high. But after some amount of waiting, often 15 or 20 seconds, they begin to doubt that they are going to get right through (second face). The third face illustrates the transition from doubt to mild frustration. By now, they have heard the first and maybe second delay announcement and they know they are in a queue. The fourth face represents customers who, from their perspective, have waited too long. Often, the first thing they do when they reach an agent is tell him or her about the miserable experience they just had. That’s a bad situation because it lengthens handling time, which will back up the queue even more and cause even more customers to complain to agents—a downward spiral. And there’s another phenomenon that kicks in here. Customers who have waited a long time in queue tend to “dig in their heels” as they attempt to squeeze all the value out of the interaction that they can: “Um, I’d better go over a few other things while I have you.”"

    "paragraph": "Visible Queue There’s a fascinating history of organizations that pioneered ways to make wait times known to customers. Software company WordPerfect (now part of Corel Corporation) created the first “visible queue” (or more literally, “audible queue”) in the mid-1980s. They set up their system to enable live “queue jockeys” to make announcements of expected hold times to callers. They could also play music and deliver announcements to keep callers entertained and informed while they waited: Thank you for calling WordPerfect. If you’re calling for assistance with Version 2, there are nine of you in queue, and if you just joined us, it looks like the wait is just over three minutes. If you are calling for Version 3, there are 18 callers in queue. But we’ve got a few more support reps there this morning, and it looks like your wait will be about two minutes. Now, here’s Kenny G from his latest album… WordPerfect discovered that customers who abandon a visible queue do so at the beginning. Those who decide to wait generally do so until they reach an agent. Many contact center managers keep a diligent eye on how many customers abandon (give up on a call, chat, or other type of contact). But when customers abandon is also an important consideration. If they are abandoning early on because they are making an informed choice, that’s much different than waiting for what seems like a long time in an invisible queue before abandoning in frustration. What the queue jockey never said, but what was implicit in the message, was something like: Thanks for calling. If you’re going to abandon, would you kindly do so now, before you get frustrated, drive up our costs and clog up the queue only to abandon anyway? Other software companies, including archrival Microsoft, soon followed WordPerfect’s lead. The feedback from customers was overwhelmingly positive. But having real-time, live queue jockeys proved impractical for most organizations. So, automatic call distributors (ACDs) that could “tell time” began to appear in the early 1990s. With this technology, the system can analyze real-time variables, make predictions, and announce expected wait times to customers as they arrive. Today’s virtual queue capabilities go a step further, giving customers the option to hang up and receive a callback when an agent becomes available, without losing their place in queue—see discussion, Can You Eliminate The Wait for Customers? Estimated wait times are a great feature, but there’s a catch. These systems provide fairly accurate predictions in reasonably straightforward environments, especially for large agent groups. However, if you are using any form of priority or skills-based routing, the system can outsmart itself. Some customers have found themselves actually moving backward in queue as “priority” calls arrive and are moved to the front of the queue. (You have to be very careful about how you set up routing, a subject we’ll cover in Chapter 7.) This is a challenge that s"

    "paragraph": "(e.g., to continue to wait or receive a callback without losing their place in queue). Even more, of course, they want short or no waits. And if there is much of a queue, customers increasingly expect contact centers to announce or display wait times. The Seven Factors Affecting Customer Tolerance The third driving force in contact centers is customer tolerance. There are seven factors that affect tolerance. They influence how long customers will wait in queue, how many will abandon, whether they will try alternative channels, and how they feel about the overall experience (based on the expectations they had). They include: 1. DEGREE OF MOTIVATION. How important is the interaction to customers? What are the consequences to them of not getting through? How badly do they need the product or service? For example, customers experiencing a power outage will usually wait longer to reach their utility than those with billing questions. 2. AVAILABILITY OF SUBSTITUTES. Even though they are highly motivated to initiate a contact, customers who encounter difficulties may abandon if they know of another way to get help. Self-service, communities found online, or even physically going to a retail location are examples of substitutes. If customers are highly motivated and have no acceptable alternatives, they will generally wait a long time in queue (and will retry if they get busy signals). Even though they do not abandon, they still might be very unhappy about the experience. 3. COMPETITION’S SERVICE LEVEL. If it’s easier for customers to use competitive services and if they have a tough time reaching you, they may go elsewhere. (You’ll need to consider whether competition is available in a practical sense. For example, if you are a bank and a customer has a problem with an online payment, a competitive bank is not going to be able to help—although if the problem is difficult to get resolved, the customer may decide to take their future business elsewhere.) It’s also important to consider that a contact center is often its own competition—customers may choose incorrect routing selections in the IVR or simultaneously try other channels just to reach an agent…any agent…more quickly. This leads to transferred contacts, inaccurate reports, longer handling times and other problems. 4. LEVEL OF EXPECTATIONS. The experiences customers have had with the contact center and the reputation that the organization has for service have a direct impact on tolerance. A 10-minute wait for tax help during filing season may be perceived as good service—but a similar wait for a shipping company that has a reputation for speedy service would be an unpleasant surprise. And, as discussed in Chapter 2, the services that customers receive from any organization, including those in other industries, have a bearing on their expectations. 5. TIME AVAILABLE.

    "paragraph": "6. WHO’S PAYING FOR THE CONTACT? Customers are usually more tolerant when they are not paying to contact an organization. Most organizations offer toll-free service. In the rare cases they don’t, a large percentage of customers will likely have calling plans that provide nationwide calling. But there’s a rub: If a customer’s plan is based on blocks of minutes, they can get understandably upset if the time they purchased is wasted in queue. (Virtual queue capabilities can help in this case—see discussion, Can You Eliminate the Wait for Customers?) 7. HUMAN BEHAVIOR. The weather, the customer’s mood, and the day’s news all have some bearing on customer tolerance. These seven factors are not static. They are constantly changing. Even so, it’s important to have a general understanding of the factors affecting your customers’ tolerance. Important questions to consider include: ▪ How motivated are your customers? ▪ What are their expectations? ▪ How do their expectations vary based on the reason for the contact? ▪ What alternatives to contacting you do they have? ▪ Which alternatives would you want/not want them to use? ▪ Will they already have spent time seeking help (e.g., search or self-service)? ▪ What level of service are others in the industry providing? ▪ How do customers tend to rate your service at different service levels? ▪ What is your customers’ tendency to share experiences, good or bad? ▪ What level of service best reflects your brand? Thinking through your customers’ situations and expectations will help you shape services that meet their needs. This is not an exact science, but it’s very helpful to understand your customers’ perspectives as much as you can. ✽✽✽ A Classic Case Study in Customer Tolerance A one-of-a-kind campaign by British Airways provided a formative case study in customer tolerance. In 1997, to celebrate its 10th anniversary since privatization, British Airways launched an international phone promotion that drew tens of millions of callers. The contest offered customers the chance to win virtually free tickets to fly round-trip on the Concorde, British Airway’s legendary (and now retired) supersonic jet, if they were among the first 100 callers to reach the center once the promotion officially began."
  },
  {
    "page": 47,
    "paragraph": "The airline designated its Newcastle, England, contact center to handle all calls during the promotion and doubled its staff. With a great deal of pomp and circumstance, the contest was kicked off on a Tuesday at 10 p.m. (yes, 10 p.m.) To minimize the use of annoying busy signals, British Airways used a recorded message that gave callers information about the promotion and thanked them for calling. As expected, most callers who got the announcement kept trying to get through; those who reached the queue were willing to wait and abandonment was negligible—hardly anyone hung up. Just 25 minutes after the contest began— and an astonishing 20 million call attempts later—the promotion was over. ✽✽✽ Putting Abandonment in Perspective In many contact centers, abandonment rate is viewed as a key measure of how adequately the center is staffed. I often get questions like, “What’s an acceptable rate of abandonment? What is abandonment in such-and-such industry? What should our service level be to keep abandonment under X percent?” The usual assumptions are: a) there must be industry standards for abandonment; and b) abandonment is a good indicator of contact center performance. Neither is true. For one thing, abandonment is tough to forecast accurately, at least on a consistent basis. To do so would require predicting the impact of the seven factors of customer tolerance. But because the conditions that drive those factors are constantly changing, an almost unlimited number of variables can have an impact on abandonment. And keep in mind that abandonment can be a misleading measure of performance. The conventional wisdom is that longer queues translate into higher abandonment. But the seven factors can help to explain apparent paradoxes: ▪ Customers who are waiting may be simultaneously using alternatives to search for relevant information; abandonment could mean they found what they needed. ▪ When financial markets swing significantly, companies in the financial sector get a surge of contacts. Even though service level may drop, abandonment also often goes down because customers have a higher degree of motivation and are willing to wait longer. ▪ When utilities or cable providers have network outages, customers (though not happy about it) are generally willing to wait longer than under normal circumstances. Service level may drop, but abandonment will often be lower than usual. While these may be obvious examples, what about the more subtle day-to-day shifts in tolerance? It can be baffling. Sometimes, when people have to wait a long time, they wait. Other times, when service level is really good, abandonment is higher than expected. ✽✽✽"

    "paragraph": "Can You Eliminate the Wait? One way to eliminate abandonment would be to eliminate the queue. Realistically, though, having every contact go immediately to an agent is highly impractical. The reason is the law of diminishing returns: When agents are added, the improvements in service level that can be attributed to each additional agent will eventually decline (see Chapter 9). The table below illustrates this phenomenon."

    "paragraph": "Virtual queuing technologies enable customers to hang up and receive a return call without losing their place in queue. For customers, this prevents the need to leave a voicemail or to wait on hold. For agents, there’s little difference between an inbound call and a callback—the system places outbound calls and delivers connected calls to agents, much like inbound calls. How well this approach works depends on the willingness and availability of customers to take callbacks and the resource capacity of the center to handle the calls. It can be especially useful in organizations influenced by weather, service outages and other factors beyond their control (travel, utilities, etc.). It’s not for every situation—if customers are not available when return calls arrive, the ensuing message cycle can weigh heavily on resources and customer patience. You’ll also need to understand how your system tracks and reports service level so that you’re interpreting it correctly."

    "paragraph": "Organizations including Southwest Airlines, FirstEnergy, Royal Bank of Canada, and others cite favorable results, such as drops in abandonment and boosts in customer satisfaction. There’s no getting around the laws of supply and demand—you’ll need a certain level of resources for the workload. But virtual queues can take some of the edge off of bunched up contacts while providing more convenience to customers. ✽✽✽ (These cautions in mind, some researchers are doing excellent work to better anticipate and account for abandonment. One is Ger Koole, a mathematician and professor at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, who uses methods such as the “Kaplan–Meier estimator” to make statistical estimates of the patience of customers. I fully support these efforts. As long as abandonment does not become the primary basis for resource planning, these studies can provide insight that leads to better understanding customer behavior.) Organizations that maintain high levels of service see abandonment rates of generally no more than one or two percent (see discussions on service level and abandonment in Chapter 4). No organization has zero abandonment for long—unless they are handling every contact immediately, something even emergency service centers can’t always do. Any time there is a wait of any length, there is opportunity for customers to abandon. ✽✽✽ Points to Remember ‣ Most contact centers handling customer-initiated contacts have random workload arrival. The type of workload you handle—smooth, random, or peaked—will dictate the staffing calculations you should use. ‣ Customers behave differently depending on whether the queue is visible or invisible. If possible, they prefer to know how long the wait will be—and will then either abandon right away or wait until they reach an agent. ‣ There are seven factors that affect customer tolerance. The impact they have is constantly changing. ‣ You cannot directly control abandonment, but you can control how accessible you are. Concentrate on accurately matching resources with workload, and abandonment will take care of itself."

Without overarching objectives that enable accessibility—service level and response time, as we’ll see— the answers to many important questions would be left to chance. How long will customers have to wait? What is the ideal level of staff and supporting resources? How busy are your agents going to be? Do you have the resources needed to support new products or services? Service level ties the resources you need to the results you want to achieve. It measures the degree to which you’re getting contacts “in the door” and to agents. It is a stable target for planning and budgeting. Is service level more important than quality? Or building customer relationships? Of course not—but it’s a prerequisite. Nothing can happen until you get contacts to where they are supposed to go, so that they can be handled effectively. For contacts that must be handled as they occur, service level as a measurement of accessibility is tried and true in centers worldwide. Inbound calls are a common example, and interactions that include chat, click-to-talk, time-sensitive social media interactions, and video calls also fit into this category. Most contact centers are also responsible for contacts that belong in a second category— those that don’t have to be handled right away. Examples include most email messages, many types of outbound calls, the contacts through social media channels that can be deferred, postal mail, and others. These interactions allow larger windows of time to respond. It is important to have specific response time objectives for these contacts and ensure that they are met through disciplined resource planning and management. Don’t make the mistake of treating them as “fillers” in between service level contacts."

    "paragraph": "Service Level and Response Time Defined The term service level is often used to refer to an organization’s overall responsiveness to customer contacts. But, when applied to resource calculations, service level has a specific expression: “X percent of contacts answered within Y seconds\" (e.g., 90 percent of calls answered within 20 seconds). “Answer” in this context means that the contact reached an agent so that he or she can begin to handle it. So, a call begins with the greeting; chat begins when the agent begins interacting with the customer; a social media contact is “answered” when it reaches the agent and he or she begins replying. (It’s always a good idea to find out how your system defines and treats service level and response time. There can be differences from one supplier to the next, and I always feel more comfortable when I understand what’s going on.) There are various alternative terms for service level. Service level is sometimes referred to as telephone service factor, or TSF, which obviously sounds like it’s limited to phone calls. Some call it grade of service (GOS), although I don’t prefer that term because it’s more typically used to quantify the degree of blocking on a group of trunks (see Chapter 7). It can also be called service standard or simply accessibility. A few things service level is not: ▪ Average speed of answer (ASA)"

Response time can be referred to as speed of reply, time to response, or even “service level” (not to be confused with the specific definition of service level). Throughout the book, I will use response time in the specific sense described here, to refer to the level of service assigned to contacts that don’t have to be handled right away. Differentiating between service level and response time is essential because base staff calculations are different. Service level is used in situations with randomly arriving contacts and requires Erlang C or computer simulation to determine staff requirements. Response time contacts can be held for later processing and can rely on the traditional methods of staff planning often used outside of contact centers. (We’ll discuss these calculations in Chapter 7.) There is a point at which response time objectives become service level objectives. For example, some organizations have upped email response time objectives from 24 hours to within the same hour. Some are going even further and handling email, social media contacts, and other customer interactions as they occur. For targets of less than an hour, service level (not response time) becomes the defining objective. ✽✽✽ Two Major Categories of Contacts ▪ Those that must be handled as they occur. Performance objective: service level ▪ Those that can be handled at a later time. Performance objective: response time ✽✽✽ Some contact types are easy to categorize. For example, phone, video, or walk-in customers are service level interactions. Most customer email messages don’t have to be processed when they arrive and are usually treated as response time interactions. But what about interactions through social media? That depends. If a customer tweets that their power is out, it probably should be responded to sooner rather than later.

And as we’ll see in more detail in later chapters, it is the most stable measurement of the queue. Average speed of answer (ASA) is a close cousin of service level and is derived from the same set of data. But ASA is often misinterpreted. Most of us tend to assume that the average lies somewhere in the middle of a set of data, or that average represents a “typical experience.” Not so with ASA. It is mathematically correct, but it does not represent what happens to individual callers. ✽✽✽ Service Level ▪ Provides a link between resources and results ▪ Affects customer goodwill and word of mouth ▪ Affects abandoned (lost) calls ▪ Affects channel switching and simultaneous contacts ▪ Affects agent burnout and errors ▪ Focuses planning and budgets ✽✽✽ ASA has its uses, so don’t throw it out.

Service level also has a direct impact on channel hopping, which occurs when customers switch to different access alternatives. If they encounter an extended wait, they might use self- service alternatives, try different IVR menu selections (which is, technically, the same channel but a different routing alternative), switch from chat to phone or vice versa, send a direct message to the company through a social channel, or throw up their hands and send a message to the world (Have been waiting on hold for 20 minutes now to reach @XYZco. #Fail!). Or, they might try simultaneous (parallel) contacts and see which generates a response first. Different customers have different experiences with your contact center, even if they are part of the same set of data measured by service level, ASA and other reports. Why? Random workload arrival. Because of this reality, you will need an understanding of what happens to different customers. At a high level, service level is the single best measure of these queue experiences. ✽✽✽ Average Speed of Answer Is Misleading Average speed of answer (ASA) reflects the amount of time customers spend in queue, waiting to reach agents. It’s available from virtually any ACD. It’s widely used and reported—and it’s misleading. ASA is mathematically sound, no problem there. The problem is in interpretation. Let’s say you expect 250 contacts in a given half hour and anticipate an average handling time of 3.5 minutes. If you want to achieve an ASA of between 10 and 15 seconds, you’ll need 34 agents, which will produce an ASA of 12.7 seconds (these calculations are based on Erlang C, covered in Chapter 7). But the following illustration gives the waiting times for individual customers in this scenario. Notice what happens. Sixty- five customers will wait 5 seconds or longer. In the next 5 seconds, 7 of those customers reach agents, so 58 customers are still waiting 10 seconds or longer. In the next 5 seconds, 6 more customers will reach agents, leaving 52 waiting 15 seconds or more. And so forth. There’s still a customer waiting at 3 minutes. As you can see, no customer is waiting 4 minutes or more."

    "paragraph": "✽✽✽ How Systems Calculate Service Level There are a number of ways systems can be set up to calculate service level. (My thanks to consultant Cheryl Odee Helm for providing a summary for an earlier edition of this book.) You will need to know which calculation is being used since each handles abandoned calls differently. Here are some common formulas for calculating service level: 1. (CONTACTS ANSWERED IN Y SECONDS + CONTACTS ABANDONED IN Y SECONDS) ÷ (TOTAL CONTACTS ANSWERED + TOTAL CONTACTS ABANDONED). This calculation takes all contacts into consideration and is generally a good approach. Contacts that abandon before the objective (e.g., 20 seconds) help—not hurt—service level. 2. CONTACTS ANSWERED IN Y SECONDS ÷ TOTAL CONTACTS ANSWERED. This alternative only considers contacts reaching agents and is not a good reflection of all activity. Outsourcers being measured on abandonment like it, because a high abandonment rate does not “ding” them on service level too. But given that abandonment is entirely ignored, I do not recommend this calculation. 3. CONTACTS ANSWERED IN Y SECONDS ÷ (TOTAL CONTACTS ANSWERED + TOTAL CONTACTS ABANDONED). This alternative tends to be the least popular among many contact center managers because all contacts that abandon, even those that abandon before the objective, negatively affect service level. It’s a favorite of some, though. As consultant Laura Grimes puts it, “It’s the high road calculation; it gives me an edge over other methods in building a business case for agents.” 4. CONTACTS ANSWERED IN Y SECONDS ÷ (TOTAL CONTACTS ANSWERED + CONTACTS ABANDONED AFTER Y SECONDS). With this calculation, abandoned contacts only have a negative impact on service level if they happen after the Y seconds specified. Contacts that abandon before the objective do not affect service level. This calculation is a way to avoid getting “penalized” by customers who abandon quickly without ignoring abandoned contacts altogether. All things considered, this is a good approach. Whatever approach you settle on, it’s important to use it consistently and ensure others understand the assumptions you are making. And if you’re in a multisite operation, or have a mix of internal and outsourced services, you should all use the same formula. You may have different service levels for different queues, but use the same formula. Giving Service Level Teeth For service level to have meaning, you must view it over an appropriate time frame. Daily service level reports often conceal important information. Service level can take a big hit in the morning, but if you have staff handling every contact immediately much of the afternoon, the daily report may look fine. The level of service from customers’ perspectives is a different story."
  },

    "page": 58,
    "paragraph": "Managers who are held accountable for daily reports have an incentive to manage inappropriately. If the morning was rough, they may keep agents plugged in and handling the work through the afternoon just to make the reports look better. That’s a waste of time and resources, and it doesn’t help customers who encountered poor service earlier in the day. If daily reports are potentially misleading, monthly averages for service level are virtually meaningless. They simply don’t reflect the day-by-day, half-hour-by-half-hour realities. Monthly reports that aggregate data remain an all-too-common way to summarize activity to senior management (we’ll look at better alternatives in Chapter 10)."

    "page": 58,
    "paragraph": "Generally, reports only tell you what is happening to the contacts that get through. If your contact center uses busy signals or messages to deflect work, then service level must be interpreted in light of contacts that aren’t getting through. In fact, you can (but should not) make reports such as service level and average speed of answer look as good as you want by limiting the contacts that get through or manipulating order of answer. ✽✽✽ WAIT—THAT’S CHEATING! I once did some consulting work for a contact center handling service for a large utility. They had two people, referred to as “traffic controllers,” who monitored the queue and helped facilitate staffing adjustments as necessary."

    "paragraph": "I learned they had a few tricks up their sleeves. For example, if service level began to slip, they would take blocks of queued calls and put them into a holding pattern, allowing calls just entering the system to go right to agents. As the queue settled down, they would release the calls from the holding pattern and allow them to reach agents. It was like putting aircraft over a busy airport into a holding pattern and allowing newer arrivals to land first. In this way, they could literally control their service level results—or at least how they appeared in reports. The happy ending is that they acknowledged and stopped the practice, and (though the reports looked worse for a while) were able to make meaningful adjustments to staffing levels. It was a good reminder: there are many ways to make reports tell any story you want. But if you want to improve, you must have accurate information that relays the unvarnished truth. ✽✽✽ Choosing Service Level Objectives The number of staff you need to handle contacts and the schedules you produce should flow from your service level objective. Imagine that, in a half-hour period, you’re going to receive 50 contacts that take an average of five minutes to handle. If you have only two agents, the delay time for most customers will be long, and you’ll probably have high abandonment. As you add agents, delay times will drop. How many people should you add? Enough to reduce the queue to an acceptable level for you and your customers. In other words, the answer to that question becomes your service level target, and you won’t be able to achieve your target without the correct level of resources. There is generally no “industry standard” service level that you can rely on for guidance. (There are exceptions: for example, service levels for many utilities are regulated.) The optimum service level is affected by a host of factors, including the value of contacts, fully loaded labor costs, telecommunications and bandwidth costs, customer tolerances, the organization’s customer access strategy and the desire and commitment to differentiate through service. An industry standard would require that organizations have the same values for these things. The correct service level for your organization is the one that: ▪ Supports the organization’s mission and brand ▪ Meets customers’ needs and expectations ▪ Keeps abandonment at acceptable levels ▪ Minimizes agent burnout and errors ▪ Minimizes expenses ▪ Maximizes revenue ▪ Is understood and supported by senior management There are essentially five approaches you can use to determine your service level objectives."

    "paragraph": "Each involves some subjectivity and requires good judgment. One is to listen to the voice of the customer, including customer feedback gathered through interactions, surveys, focus groups, and comments and ratings provided through social channels. You will also want to think through the seven factors of customer tolerance (see Chapter 3). There’s a caution, though. While it’s always important to know what your customers expect, random contact arrival means that different customers have different experiences. Even for a relatively modest service level such as 80 percent answered in 60 seconds, more than half of the customers will get an immediate answer. Some, though, will wait in queue for 3 to 5 minutes, assuming no overflow or other contingency (we’ll go over how to make these calculations in Chapter 7). As a result, many in that set of customers would say that your service level is great, while a handful would tell you that it is poor. ✽✽✽ ALTERNATIVES FOR CHOOSING A SERVICE LEVEL OBJECTIVE ▪ Listen to the voice of the customer ▪ Go with a “typical” objective ▪ Relate to competition—go higher/lower ▪ Minimize abandonment ▪ Use a combined approach ✽✽✽ Here’s an interesting survey approach I’ve seen some managers take. They query individual customers about how long they waited in queue (with encouragement to not glance at the timer on their phone). They then compare the responses with the actual wait times of those contacts. In many customer service settings, waits of up to 60–90 seconds are okay with customers. But beyond about 90 seconds, customers’ view of reality can become skewed, and their moods can sour. Those who wait 3 minutes in queue may say they waited 4 or 5. Those who wait 5 minutes will often tell you they waited 8 or 10 minutes. At some point as service deteriorates, perception is worse than reality, so you’ll want to consider what your customers believe is happening (see figure, Perception of the Queue)."

    "paragraph": "A second approach is to choose a typical or “middle-of-the-road” service level objective, such as 80 percent of contacts reach agents within 20 seconds. The 80/20 objective was once published in ACD manuals as an industry standard. In reality, it never was, but many early call centers used this target. The objective 80/20 is still fairly common because for many contact centers it is a reasonable balance between customers’ expectations and the practicality of having enough staff to meet the objective. It may or may not be right for you. A third alternative for choosing service level objectives is to look at competitive or industry norms and determine whether you want to emulate them or stand out. Chewy.com, a Florida- based online retailer of pet supplies, answers most calls within five seconds. If you mention the organization in a social media channel, a “Chewtopian” usually responds in a matter of minutes. This accessibility—and the amazing service you get once connected—has helped Chewy thrive in a competitive market. When benchmarking, keep in mind that the results reported by others and what they are actually achieving may be two very different things. I recall working with two different insurance companies that, at first glance, seemed similar. But according to surveys, one had far happier customers and employees. On deeper dive, it became clear that this organization was delivering services much more consistently, tracking and managing it by increment. The other company was reporting service level as an average for the month, and was predictably getting clobbered on Monday mornings and at other key times. You have to know what’s really happening for benchmarks to make sense."

    "paragraph": "A fourth method is to ask, how low can you go without losing customers? A big downside to this approach is that abandonment levels and service levels don’t always correlate. Even so, it can be a helpful consideration. Incremental revenue analysis is a formal methodology to determine the potential impact of abandonment on overall costs. This approach has been traditionally applied in revenue- generating environments—e.g., retail companies or nonprofit organizations that depend on contributions—where contacts have a measurable value. (It’s difficult to apply in centers where there’s no revenue attributed to contacts.) To use the incremental revenue analysis approach, you attach a cost to abandoned contacts and make assumptions on how many contacts you would lose for various service levels. The theory is you should continue to add agents and system resources as long as they produce positive incremental (additional) revenue (value) after paying for their own costs (see example). Incremental revenue analysis can be valuable when used in conjunction with other approaches, as long as the assumptions (especially the uncertainties of predicting abandonment) are understood. Don’t let the scientific look of this approach mislead you—it requires some pretty serious guesswork! Incremental Revenue Analysis Example"

    "paragraph": "A fifth and overall best approach is an iterative process that combines the strengths of each of the other methods. Think through all of these issues, then come up with service level objectives that best reflect your organization’s brand and the expectations of your customers. See how they work in the real world, and agree to revise your objectives if (and only if) absolutely necessary. Whichever combination of methods you choose, you will have more success managing your contact center by having a service level target on which to base your planning. Showing senior management what kind of service can be bought for a specific amount of funding is an excellent way to involve them in the decision and to get their buy-in from the beginning."

    "paragraph": "✽✽✽ THE QUICK VERSION OF CHOOSING A SERVICE LEVEL OBJECTIVE I often hear, “Okay, the analysis is fine, but let’s get to the point: What should our service level objective be?” Fair enough. If you’re in a competitive industry, such as retail, shipping, or mutual funds, and want to be on the high end of the scale, 90/20 is fairly common. Others go for 85/15 or 90/15. If you hit these targets fairly consistently, your abandonment rate will likely be around 1 percent or 2 percent. Going for the middle of the road? 80/20 is common. That’s what a lot of banks, insurance companies and travel reservation centers shoot for. Other popular mid-range service levels are 80/30 and 90/60. Hit any of these objectives consistently, and you’ll generally see abandonment rates of 3 percent or 4 percent. Want a service level that is more modest? Targets common with many technical support centers and government organizations are 70/60, 80/120 or even 80/300. Abandonment can climb to 10 percent, 15 percent or higher. But hold your judgment—some of these organizations do a great job of using the resources they have to hit these objectives consistently. Of course, there are exceptions to the norm in any industry. For example, technical support operations that charge for support, or that serve internal customers who have time-sensitive requirements, maintain comparatively high service levels. Also, interpret these numbers with common sense. If you are an emergency service center, you will target 100/0. On the other end of the scale, there are centers for which 80/300 is a dream. I once worked with a center that was blocking over 70 percent of customer contacts, yet still losing a large portion of those that got through due to excruciatingly long waits (they’ve since dramatically turned things around). Above all, remember that it’s not just how high your objectives are, but how consistently you hit them. If you really want to see how you’re doing and what realistic targets might be, produce service level graphs like those shown in Chapter 8. ✽✽✽ Realistic Targets, Taken Seriously If your operation is chronically missing your target, it may be an indication of a fundamental misconception about the importance of service level. You’ll need to focus on a service level objective that your organization can realistically achieve. Once you know your center’s true capabilities, you must be able to back up your objectives with the right amount of resources. Service level should not be a “goal,” something that is nice to strive for. An airline doesn’t have the “goal” of reaching Montréal when the plane takes off from Mexico City. It’s a concrete objective, supported by adequate resources (fuel, pilots, navigation equipment, etc.). Why is it that some contact centers don’t get the resources they need? Sometimes it’s because the money isn’t available. Or maybe management at the top believes that it’s possible to achieve the service level target with the current level of resources, thi"

    "paragraph": "SERVICE LEVEL ACROSS CHANNELS Contact center professionals often liken the time it takes for customers to receive a reply to a non-phone contact to what service level means to inbound calls. But there is an important difference: speed-of-answer statistics associated with calls are based on when the call reaches the agent. But speed-of-response for other kinds of contacts—e.g., chat, social media, text, email —is based on when the customer receives a reply, which can only happen after the agent actually handles the inquiry. Is this distinction important? That depends. For email—where response time is typically measured in hours—it doesn’t matter much (see discussion on response time, below). But chat and social media interactions that need to take place as they arise are a different matter. Response is measured in seconds or minutes, and the time required for the agent to craft the reply must be taken into account. I’ve seen cases where well-intentioned executives set a target for exchanges of three minutes or less when it takes longer than that to create the reply! That’s a recipe for disaster (or, at the least, for missed targets). It is up to the management team to establish workable objectives supported by the right level of resources. ✽✽✽ Understanding and Using Response Time Objectives Response time is the equivalent of service level for contacts that don’t have to be handled when they arrive. Response time, like service level, becomes the critical link between the resources you need and the results you want to achieve. Variations on Response Time There are often several components to the organization’s response. The most common are: AUTOMATED REPLY: This is a system-generated reply to the customer, acknowledging that a message they sent was received and informing them of when to expect an agent-assisted response. This establishes appropriate expectations and minimizes additional contacts inquiring about the status of the original message. AGENT-ASSISTED RESPONSE: This refers to the response the customer receives when the interaction is actually handled by an agent. The time that elapses between the customer’s original message and the contact center’s response is measured as response time. RESOLUTION: This is a measure of when the problem or issue is actually resolved and is used in environments where the contact center’s initial response may not fully resolve the issue. For example, in a technical support environment, additional research may be necessary; the problem is “resolved” when the matter is handled to completion and the case is closed. Additionally, there are two primary types of response time, scheduled and rolling. Scheduled response time, like dry-cleaning service, is geared around blocks of time. For example, you may commit to handle all messages received up to noon by 4 p.m., and to respond to messages received between noon and 5 p.m. by 10 a.m. the next day. Rolling response time is hinged on the specific time each message a"

But some have raised the bar and set objectives of several hours or less. A small but growing number of centers are handling what used to be response-time-type contacts (such as email or social media messages) as they do inbound calls: queuing them and handling them as they arrive. In this case, service level (rather than response time) objectives apply. An important step in establishing response time objectives is to inform customers up front what they can expect. Otherwise, what started as a single inquiry that is still in queue can turn into additional contacts. Internal Communications"

Likewise, internal collaboration tools are becoming pervasive, but you’ll need to talk through expectations and get agreement on when and how they will best be used. The Link to Quality When you talk about being accessible, someone is bound to bring up an important point: you can achieve your service level (or response time) objectives and miss by a mile on quality. Your agents can misunderstand customer requests, enter data incorrectly, relay the wrong information to customers, miss opportunities to capture valuable feedback, and unnecessarily cause unnecessary repeat contacts. But over time and fundamentally, service level and quality are complementary. In fact, you cannot have one without the other, at least not for long. Consider how poor quality jeopardizes service level. What happens when data is not entered correctly? If the customer does not have confidence the contact was handled correctly? If you did not capture needed and useful information? These problems contribute to repeat and escalated contacts, driving down service level."

    "page": 68,
    "paragraph": "The problems tend to compound. When service level drops, customers begin channel hopping or sending simultaneous contacts. Reports are less stable for planning purposes. As service deteriorates, more and more customers express their frustration to agents, who will have to spend valuable time apologizing. Agents eventually pace themselves, further backing up queues. If this condition continues, employee morale can sink, and burnout and turnover go up. It’s an unfortunate and costly cycle. Let’s flip the script. Better quality means less waste and rework, which often dramatically improves capacity and service level. And better service levels give your agents the room they need to breathe and deliver the best quality. And remember the bigger picture, the contact center’s role in customer experience. Consider the positive impact on the organization’s workload when the contact center helps other service and production areas pinpoint and address quality problems and improve products and services. The contact center can have a positive impact on the entire organization’s workload, productivity, and quality. (We’ll look at these issues in Chapter 13.) Do you need to choose between service level and quality? Not at all. Service level and quality go hand in hand. Service level and response time objectives are enablers. Nothing happens unless contacts first get to the right places at the right times. In the chapters to follow, we will cover the planning steps required to meet your service level and response time objectives.

A critical consideration for effectively using data is to understand what it represents. “There are many ways to compile and report data and often a deeper dive is necessary to really understand it. How systems report data, what’s included, the timeframes involved, and other factors will shape the story it’s telling.” Diverse Requirements For an appreciation of the diverse information requirements in today’s customer contact environment, consider how job titles and responsibilities are evolving. Through the early 2000s, the same person or team (depending on the size of the center) would do the hiring, coaching, forecasting, and just about everything else that goes into running a contact center. Many managers were also involved in staffing and scheduling. Today, many additional job roles and responsibilities have emerged, each requiring different types of information from different sources, and with a unique combination of both “push” and “pull” requirements (see sidebar). In larger centers, job roles can include forecasting analysts, training managers, quality specialists, knowledge managers, reporting analysts, finance managers, traffic controllers, team leaders and supervisors, real-time coordinators, and professionals with a host of other titles and positions. If you run a small contact center, you probably wear many of these increasingly specialized hats! (See Chapter 16 for more on organization and job roles.) Given the need for specialized roles, along with the numerous variables affecting the contact center’s workload, it’s easy to understand why many organizations that were previously successful at developing accurate forecasts and plans are now finding this activity more challenging. The process for acquiring, interpreting, and using the data has become almost as important as the data itself. Those who view the data collection step as little more than a rote, mechanical process are severely underestimating its importance. ✽✽✽ Push and Pull Requirements Information requirements can be broadly categorized as either \"push\" or \"pull.\" Push: The information needs to be delivered as soon as it becomes available (e.g., workload trends that impact real-time resource requirements).

    "paragraph": "Identifying the Information You Need A great way to identify gaps in getting and using the data you’ll need for planning and management is to create a flowchart of the nine-step planning process (covered in Chapters 1 through 10) and the data required for each step. The chart should identify: ▪ The information you need for each step ▪ The form it should take ▪ Where it comes from ▪ How it is produced ▪ When you need it ▪ How and when it fits into the planning process This exercise will identify missing links in your data collection activities and lead to ideas for developing a more integrated, collaborative approach. For best results, you’ll need to update your flowchart fairly regularly (I suggest twice yearly). A similar approach can be used for other operational priorities, such as quality improvement. Building Cross-Functional Processes Identifying the information you need begins with a clear customer access strategy. Your customer access strategy will help to define such things as customer segments, agent group structure, service level objectives, the information needed for handling contacts, and so on (see Chapter 2). The components of your strategy will, in turn, help define specific data requirements. Many contact centers have assigned a person or a group of people to handle essential planning responsibilities (i.e., forecasting, staffing, and scheduling). As a part of their job, they are given the task of collecting information required for these activities. But if they don’t get the cross-functional input they need, this becomes more difficult at best. The organizations that do the best job of planning have developed cross-functional planning teams. As part of both planning and voice of the customer strategies, some organizations hold regular (typically weekly) meetings with representatives from departments throughout the organization who review customer input and implications for projects and processes. And given the many diverse aspects of good planning, some organizations have established a “planning manager” position whose primary function is to enhance cross-functional communication within the organization and use the shared information to drive better forecasts and plans. Cross-functional planning groups can take many forms. Some examples: ▪ Daily huddles have become an important part of many contact centers.

    "paragraph": "One of the key benefits of ACD, workforce optimization, quality observation, customer relationship management (CRM), and other contact center systems has always been their ability to produce reports—lots of them. In the past, reporting was system-specific and based primarily on parameters defined by the suppliers. Today’s systems are characterized by flexibility and interfaces that allow reporting and integration across an organization (and beyond, to include service partners, suppliers, and others). Anyone who is granted access can view, extract, manipulate, make graphical, print, and store real-time and historical information. This trend has been enormously helpful in raising the contact center’s profile within the organization. Most systems also have the capability to export data to a variety of formats. This allows anyone with some technical skill (they don’t need to be programmers) to develop custom reports that combine information from multiple systems. The result has been reports and analysis that give a much more three-dimensional view of customer interactions—i.e., you can correlate details such as contact types, channels, quality scores and contact trends with customer demographics, marketing campaigns, sales, customer satisfaction, buying histories, and other relevant information. Another highly useful development is the ability to model and test different scenarios. Examples include: ▪ Quality observation, text and speech analytics, and performance management tools can use"

These forward-looking capabilities are major improvements over relying primarily on historical reports to identify problems and improvement opportunities. New Responsibilities Emerging information capabilities are creating challenges that necessitate informed and active leadership. For example, communications monitoring technologies are in widespread use. However, too many organizations implement these technologies without adequate training on appropriate policies and practices. In many cases, supervisors have been handed technologies with potentially enormous legal, quality and productivity implications. And within organizations with multiple sites, policies and practices often differ between locations. A related challenge is the balance between service and privacy, and the uneasiness many customers feel about the sheer quantity of information that is being captured, shared, integrated with other data, and used for management and marketing purposes. And employees can feel much the same: “The computer watches me all the time; it never blinks.” These issues require sound and up-to-date policies on customer privacy, data protection, internal observation practices and good communication with all involved. (See Chapter 14 for more on quality observation and related issues.) Some managers have also assumed that new systems can practically “run the business.” And yet, an understanding of underlying processes and a supporting culture are necessary for these capabilities to reach their potential. For example: ▪ Workforce optimization systems don’t coordinate with marketing, watch economic reports, or define how the organization should be structured. ▪ Quality observation systems can’t define quality standards or the strategic value of excellent quality for your operation. ▪ Real-time management information can’t compel agents to want to be in the right place at the right times. ▪ The rich information provided by reporting, analytics, and collaboration tools doesn’t inherently bring business units together to create better products, services, and customer experiences. As capable as today’s systems are, they require effective leadership and clear direction."

Ensuring that those in your contact center are getting (and correctly using) the right information at the right times for the right purposes is a key leadership responsibility and an important enabler to running an effective operation. Revisit and Refine This Step Data collection is a planning step that you’ll need to continually reassess and improve. Don’t leave it to chance—make a date with yourself to regularly revisit the issue of how you are using information and why. Which information is relevant? How do you want the information formatted and presented? Who should have access to what? How will the information be used? And remember to keep your eye on the prize. The purpose of information is to support key activities of the contact center that, in turn, further the mission of the organization. To that end, we’ll look at the specific information you’ll need in chapters to follow. ✽✽✽ Points to Remember ‣ The data required for contact center planning and management comes from numerous internal and external sources. ‣ It is important to understand how data is captured and reported. How systems handle and report data, timeframes involved, and other factors will influence the messages in it. ‣ Acquiring and using the information you need must be a collaborative, cross-functional effort. ‣ Develop a flowchart of the information required for each of the key aspects of contact center planning and management; this will help to identify weak or missing links and point to collaboration opportunities. ‣ Continually review and improve your information systems and processes to ensure that they are supporting your organization’s objectives."

    "paragraph": "Key Terms and Essential Data Forecasting is a mix of art and science. It begins with predicting how many contacts you are going to get in a future period, usually 12 months. To do that, you first look at historical data to determine patterns that reflect when people contact you, and you consider possible trends that will affect patterns going forward. You then take that information and break it into contacts by months, weeks of the month, days of the week, and half hours of the day—or even five minutes of the half hour if you are forecasting peaked traffic. Next, you factor in the handling times of the interactions. Finally, you modify results based on conditions that are not reflected in the historical data. Weekly, daily, and intraday forecasts are short-term tactical forecasts used to tighten up schedules and adjust priorities around current conditions and near-term events. Shorter-term forecasts project workload for the upcoming three months. They are necessary for organizing and adjusting scheduling requirements, anticipating seasonal staffing needs, planning for holidays, and determining imminent hiring requirements. Longer-term forecasts project workload for a year and beyond. They are used to estimate future annual budgets, establish long-term hiring plans, and define future system needs. How far out you forecast will depend on the purpose of the forecast. Regardless, the basic terms and concepts are similar."

    "paragraph": "Agent Group Agent groups are the building blocks of a contact center. An agent group (also called a split, gate, queue, or skills group) shares a common set of skills and knowledge, handles a specified mix of contacts (e.g., service, sales, technical support) and/or channels (e.g., phone, chat, social media, email). and may comprise a handful of agents or hundreds of agents across multiple sites. Supervisory groups and teams are often subsets of agent groups. Your forecasts will be built around agent groups. If you have one group of 100 agents handling all contacts, you’ll have one forecast and one set of schedules. If you have 10 groups of around 10 agents, you’ll need 10 forecasts and schedules—one for each unique agent group. In other words, planning must be specific enough to ensure that you get the right number of properly skilled people and supporting resources in place at the right times, for each agent group. Workload The basic historical data you need to forecast for an agent group includes how many contacts you have received in the past, when they arrived and how long they took to handle. Four key terms reflect this activity: ▪ TALK TIME is everything from “hello” to “goodbye.” In other words, it’s the time customers are connected with agents. Anything that happens during talk time—such as putting the customer on hold to confer with a supervisor, research an issue or make an outbound call— should be included in this measurement. ▪ AFTER-CALL WORK (also referred to as ACW, wrap-up, or not ready) is the time agents spend completing contacts after saying goodbye to customers. Legitimate after-call work should immediately follow talk time. ▪ AVERAGE HANDLING TIME (AHT) is average talk time plus average after-call work. ▪ WORKLOAD (also referred to as call load) is the volume of contacts coupled with how long they last. The formula is volume × average handling time, for a given period of time. While these terms are typical and make sense for calls, they can vary for other channels. For example, “talk time” and “after-call work” are fine for video. They don’t make sense for email or text, where “handling time” is a better fit. In an omnichannel environment, the channels you handle will dictate the terms that best describe workload components. In an omnichannel environment, the channels you handle will dictate the terms that best describe workload components. For chat or social media, the series of exchanges with a customer over a short period of time (the back-and-forth that takes place in many of these interactions) is referred to as a session (chat) or conversation (social media). You’ll need to anticipate the number of customer sessions or conversations, the time it takes to handle them and the number of customers an agent can simultaneously handle. We’ll discuss variations as we consider other channels, in this chapter"

    "paragraph": "and in Chapter 7. ✽✽✽ Clean the Data! It’s important to “clean” the data you use to forecast workload. Don’t make the mistake of taking existing data from systems and using it “as is” without giving it a second thought. What if the IVR was down for an hour? What if a reporting system malfunctioned for part of a morning? What if a breaking news story impacted workload? I remember working with a large contact center in Australia during the Melbourne Cup—the thoroughbred horse race that is one of the most-watched sporting events of the year. Just before the race, contacts plummeted, then resumed in a matter of minutes after its conclusion. It was fascinating to see the race on one monitor and follow real-time contact center traffic on another. What about unique variables in your environment that will, or will not, repeat and that need to be either included in or backed out of the numbers? Making adjustments that reflect what’s likely to continue will ensure that you are building forecasts on a solid foundation. ✽✽✽ Offered Contacts Offered contacts include all of the attempts your customers make to reach you. There are three possibilities for offered contacts: they can get a busy signal or message (rare in most contact centers); they can be received by the system but abandon before reaching an agent; or they can successfully reach an agent. In forecasting, what you really want to know is the number of individuals attempting to reach you. Acquiring data on abandoned contacts is usually straightforward. Most routing systems provide reports on abandonments down to specific increments of time."
  },
  {
    "page": 84,
    "paragraph": "Many managers count abandoned contacts “one-for-one.” But to the degree that customers who abandon try again later and get through to agents, they will be counted more than once. Consequently, you may want to “normalize” or discount them. If available, it’s helpful to have hard data, which can come from automatic number identification (ANI), calling line identification (CLI) reports, or other systems. Without good data, you run the risk of discounting too deeply, which will lead to forecasts that underestimate demand. I generally recommend that you include most (70 percent or more) abandoned contacts in the data, unless you have solid information that tells you otherwise. This may lead to forecasts that overstate demand; however, forecasts that underestimate the workload will result in insufficient staffing and abandoned contacts, which perpetuate the problem. Similarly, busy signals will need to be discounted in the data you use for forecasting. Busies are far less common today than they once were (and I rarely recommend intentionally using them). But they still can and do happen. When they do, they wreak havoc on reports. The age-old question is, for every 100 busy signals, was that 100 people who tried to reach you once, or one persistent soul who tried 100 times? Of course, the answer usually is somewhere in between. If your ACD can dynamically generate busy signals based on real-time circumstances, it will likely provide a report on how many customers received busies. Telecommunications network carriers can also provide reports that can help solve the retry mystery. Alternatives to retry reports can include customer surveys, answering all contacts for a short period (even if by voicemail) to determine true demand, and judgment (guessing). Naturally, it’s best to have hard data. In sum, your forecast should, as accurately as possible, reflect the number of individuals attempting to reach you. If you count every abandoned contact or busy signal in the data you use, the forecast will overestimate true demand. If you ignore busy signals and abandoned contacts, the forecast will underestimate demand. IVRs and Routing Contingencies Many organizations use interactive voice response units (IVRs) to provide customers with self-service options and to help route contacts (“press or say one” or “tell us the reason for your call”). Additionally, contingency-based routing alternatives can mean that contacts start out in one place and end up in another depending on real-time circumstances. I always feel most comfortable when I know how the systems are configured and how contacts reach their destinations. (I’ll often have someone walk me through a step-by-step flowchart so that I understand.) You’ll need a forecast specific to each agent group for staffing purposes. In other words, count and forecast the contacts intended for each individual agent group so that your forecasts and staff predictions are accurate going forward. Proportions The fundamental inf"

It’s pretty amazing, actually. So, one of the most essential steps in forecasting is to look at your data and identify the patterns that exist. Even if you are using forecasting software, it is still important to graph the “raw” patterns so you can identify exceptions. Breaking Down a Forecast Okay, grab that double-tall latte, and let’s go through a basic approach that illustrates how to break down a forecast. This example starts with longer-term patterns and works its way down to specific half-hour increments. The steps involved include: 1. Obtain the number of contacts received in the past 12 months (720,000 in this example). 2. Multiply the year’s contacts by 1.12 to reflect 12 percent expected growth. Factoring in growth at this level assumes that contacts will increase proportionally to previous years’ patterns. If growth will instead be concentrated around marketing campaigns or other events that don’t necessarily happen at the same time from year to year, you should factor it in at a more specific"

    "page": 89,
    "paragraph": "4. Divide the number of operation days in the month into the estimated monthly contacts. This yields average contacts per day. In this example, the center is open every day of the month. 5. Adjust average contacts per day, using the appropriate daily index factor. The first column in the index factor calculation (lower right corner) gives the proportion of the week’s contacts that typically arrive each day. For example, Monday normally gets 21 percent of the week’s traffic; Tuesday gets 17 percent, and so forth. The next column reflects the number of days in a week that the contact center is operating. If you’re open seven days a week, use 7. If five days, use 5. Even if you’re only open part of a day (e.g., a half day on Saturday), count that day. The final column is the result of multiplying the first column by the second column. These index factors are then multiplied against the average contacts per day to estimate traffic by the specific day of the week. In this example, Monday’s index factor, 1.47, is multiplied against 1,847. 6. The final step is to multiply the predicted contacts for each day of the week by each half hour’s proportion. In this example, the half hour 10:00 to 10:30 will get a projected 149 contacts."

    "paragraph": "This process must take a lot of time, right? Actually, once you establish an approach, it won’t take nearly as much time as you may think. You will get better at it with practice. And forecasting software, or even simple spreadsheets, can take much of the labor out of it. And the time you do invest is well worth it. Remember that forecasting is one of the most high-leverage activities in the planning process. You’ll spend a lot more time “putting out fires” later on if you don’t have a good forecast. This is a basic approach and there are many possible refinements—to account for calendar variations, intra-month trends, or other variables—that may improve accuracy. But if you are pulling out the exceptions and working with good data, going through this process provides a good foundation on which to build. You will still need to blend in judgment, coordinate with marketing, etc. (see upcoming discussions). After all, past history doesn’t always reflect what’s going to happen in the future. You may also need to incorporate other patterns into the forecast. For example, if you send out billing statements twice a month, that activity will generate traffic when the bills begin to arrive. But the percent increase caused by these events will also fall into predictable patterns, and you can adjust accordingly. You may need to calculate day-of-month index factors, a process similar to deriving day-of-week index factors. Holiday Weeks Holiday weeks will require their own index factors. But the pattern for one week with a holiday on a Monday will often be similar to another week in the year with a holiday on a Monday.

However, if you are a utility getting swamped with contacts in the morning due to a major power outage, this is a bad assumption. When the outage is fixed, the contacts will go away.

The other big difference is that the specific targeted promotions you are delivering— television or radio ads, for example—will dramatically influence response. That’s true for any kind of marketing, of course, but because of concentrated workload arrivals, the impact on contact center resources is that much greater. The audience you are reaching (numbers and demographics), the products and services being offered, the channels you are making available, and the effectiveness of the ads themselves will drive how many contacts you get, the nature of the interactions, and how concentrated they are within a specific timeframe. Identifying primary drivers and correlating them with response is key."

You may have a choice between running television ads at precise times, or receiving discounts to run them anytime within a larger block of time (as the network’s programming needs dictate). Ad-buy savings can quickly evaporate when you weigh the costs of having staff standing by. These decisions should be made collaboratively (including marketing, the contact center and the media partner), with the total picture in mind. Social Media Social media monitoring tools—which range from free to high-end and can be standalone or integrated into existing contact center systems—enable you to make sense of what’s being said about your company, products, and services. They can help you identify customer sentiment, influencers, where conversations are taking place, and which are having the most impact on the perception of your brand. And some social media posts are clearly customer service contacts— individuals who need and expect a response. Armed with this information, you can establish criteria for when and how to engage and determine what needs to be included in the workload that is delivered to your agents. As part of forecasting, you’ll want to divide the workload into categories, including one-to-many responses where anyone can see (and potentially benefit from) the post, versus direct messages to individuals. Further categories might include known and unknown issues—any grouping has distinct handling time requirements. If you’re launching a new channel and don’t have as much to go by, think more along the lines of forecasting the weather: Partly cloudy this morning, with a warming trend this afternoon. You won’t always get it right. Look out as far as possible, think through as many variables as feasible, and observe patterns and how they are developing. In the end, dress for any kind of weather (meaning, build flexibility and scalability into your staffing plans). The good news is that underlying patterns almost always exist. Yes, social media trending topics and posts that quickly multiply can create unique staffing challenges. But being responsive early can help head off what would be repetitive contacts. The same basic principles apply: look for patterns, consider the variables, and use what you’re seeing to project future workload.

Most agents, when given the choice, prefer to start and end earlier in the day, so they had a higher concentration of new agents (and, probably, less experienced supervisors) assigned to the evening shift. That’s not necessarily a bad approach, but it will impact average handling time and must be reflected in the forecast. Second, they did not have a good definition of or process for after-call work, and much of it was getting postponed until late in the day. Third, the mix of contact types changed throughout the day and contacts got relatively longer in the evening.

    "paragraph": "reflect the environment accurately. Some relatively simple analysis can go a long way toward tightening up your projections. Here are a few important tips for getting this part of your forecast right: 1. LOOK FOR PATTERNS. For each agent group, identify how average talk time and average after-call work vary. You may also discover patterns by day of the week, season of the year, billing cycles or marketing campaigns. For contact channels that have both, make separate graphs for average talk time and average after-call work. This will reveal the patterns for each. 2. TRAIN YOUR AGENTS TO USE WORK MODES CONSISTENTLY. Each agent has an impact on the components of handling time (talk time and after-call work) and on the data that will be used in forecasting and planning for future workloads. When the queue is building, it can be tempting to postpone some after-call work that should be done at the time of the contact. This skews reports, causes planning problems, and may lead to increased errors. An important and ongoing training issue is to define ahead of time what type of work should follow contacts and what type of work can wait. 3. IDENTIFY THE AVERAGE HANDLING TIME FOR DIFFERENT CONTACT TYPES. This assumes that you have defined and categorized contacts by type, that you are accurately tracking contacts based on the categories, and that you have the reporting capability to link average handling time to the categories. A Pareto chart is often the best way to represent this data. You can use this information in a number of ways. For example, when you are forecasting an increase or decrease of a specific type of contact, you will be able to project the impact on average handling time. A marketing campaign will generate certain types of contacts. Launching a new web-based service, AI capabilities or mobile app will likely reduce some types of contacts agents handle and may increase others. In each case, you’ll be equipped to estimate average handling time."

Less-experienced agents almost always require more time to handle contacts as they learn how to deal with processes, systems, cultures, and customers. Process changes may either add to or decrease average handling time, depending on the specifics. Additionally, some languages require more time than others (for example, French takes somewhat longer than German, and Spanish requires more time than English). Compare average handling time with the experience levels of your agents, languages handled, etc. Doing this will enable you to estimate the impact of these variables on AHT, and will be useful in establishing realistic expectations."

Beyond the Basics The major categories of quantitative forecasting include “time-series” and “explanatory” approaches. The examples in this chapter are fairly basic, and more advanced alternatives within each category exist. I’ll introduce a few of them here to give you an idea of the breadth of possibilities. Time-series forecasting methods include simple or “naive” rules (e.g., the forecast equals last year’s same month, plus 12 percent), decomposition, simple time-series, and advanced time- series methods. The governing assumption behind time-series forecasting is that past data reflects trends that will continue into the future. Time-series methodologies are common in workforce management software. Most time-series forecasts are reasonably accurate when projecting out three months or less. Explanatory forecasting methods include simple regression analysis, multiple regression analysis, econometric models, and multivariate methods. Explanatory forecasting essentially attempts to reveal a connection between two or more variables. For example, if you manage an"

In a contact center, you might correlate a price increase with the impact on contact volumes. Advanced time-series and explanatory forecasting methods go beyond the scope of this book. In fact, you can spend a couple of college semesters—make that a career—learning about forecasting. For more information, there are many courses (some of them contact center- specific), books, software tools and other resources available. ✽✽✽ SOFTWARE AND SERVICES FOR ADVANCED FORECASTING If you’re in an organization or industry going through significant changes, or if your center handles contacts generated by television commercials or overlapping direct marketing campaigns, commonly-used time-series and explanatory techniques might not cut it. Fortunately, there are alternatives. Increasingly, today’s more advanced workforce optimization systems—as well as standalone business forecasting packages from sources such as SAS Forecast Server, Forecast Pro, and others—include a wide range of forecasting methodologies. These programs enable you to build in multiple events and variables and produce forecasts based on different models. By comparing forecasts, you can identify the best methodology for your environment. Because one approach might work better than others for specific types of events, you can change models as circumstances dictate. You may need an analyst to spearhead this effort, but more accurate forecasts (and therefore, better staffing plans and schedules) often provide a solid return on the investment. You may also want to explore outside services. For example, forecasting services offered by consultants can provide forecasts based on advanced methodologies for centers that need transitional or ongoing help. Similar services exist in other fields (e.g., financial and sales forecasting), and this alternative has become common and accessible in the contact center environment. ✽✽✽ Blending in Judgment So far, we’ve looked at quantitative forecasting—in other words, how to use hard data in your forecasting process. Judgmental forecasting goes beyond purely statistical techniques and encompasses what people think is going to happen. It is in the realm of intuition, interdepartmental committees, market research and executive opinion. Many things, from organizational politics to personal agendas, can influence judgmental forecasting. However, some judgment is inherent in virtually all forms of forecasting. And a degree of good judgment can significantly improve accuracy. The trick is to combine quantitative and judgmental approaches effectively, and to be aware of the limitations of each. The worksheet “Blending in Judgment” illustrates one way of applying common sense and a logical approach to judgmental forecasting. In a customer service environment, the number of"

In this section, you customize the forecast by adding or reducing contacts, based on information you develop from your own and others’ input. For some of these factors, you may have some hard data that you can use. For others, you’ll be making more of an “educated guess.” The factors in Part D are only examples, and you will want to create your own list specific to your environment.

    "paragraph": "The meeting will typically last only 30 or 45 minutes. It often works like this: ▪ The person in charge of the meeting prepares an agenda of items to be discussed. ▪ The scheduling person (or team) prepares the quantitative forecast before the meeting. ▪ During the meeting, the attendees discuss issues that may influence the forecast, such as those in Part D of the worksheet. Each participant brings a unique perspective to the process. ▪ As each issue is discussed, the forecast is adjusted up or down, based on what the group believes will happen. The collaborative approach is most effective when key team members who are accountable for staffing take an active role in forecasting (in large contact centers, they can be rotated through this process). The forecast not only improves as a result of their perspective, but these key team members gain an understanding of the factors that contribute to staffing. As a result, they lead their teams more effectively. Measuring Accuracy—Strive for Five How accurate should your forecast be? Large agent groups (100 or more agents) generally see relatively stable workload patterns and should strive for plus or minus 5 percent (or better) of workload down to specific intervals. Small groups (15 or fewer agents) often have more volatile patterns and should shoot for plus or minus 10 percent. Those in between should strive for something close to 5 percent. This is not to suggest you can’t do better. On the other hand, if you’re just getting started with, say, a small group handling social media interactions, being even remotely close might be a pretty good start! Don’t give up. Make this aspect of planning a priority. Be relentless in your focus until you begin to get your arms around it.

    "paragraph": "When measuring accuracy, there’s a running debate over whether to use the formula (forecast - actual ÷ forecast) or (forecast - actual ÷ actual). The important thing, though, is to describe what you calculate: actuals were X percent under forecast, or the forecast was Y percent over actuals. It’s essential to look at intervals rather than an average over a day or more. One good alternative is to use mean absolute percent error (MAPE), which is the average of the percentage error regardless of whether it was over or under. The advantage to using MAPE is that it measures how far off the forecast was. As seen in the table, the day’s forecast was only off by half of a percent (.5%, or 4427 forecasted contacts versus 4407 received). The MAPE is 13.2% (the average of errors by increment with positive and negative signs removed). Another alternative is to summarize the percentage of intervals that fall within various ranges of accuracy (see example). You can summarize a week, month, year or more in this way, and still provide meaningful data. Forecast Accuracy by Interval"

    "paragraph": "Common Problems (That You Can Avoid!) The ICMI team often investigates why some contact centers have accurate forecasts and others don’t. Ten common problems consistently emerge, and they are summarized here (in no specific order). In centers with inaccurate forecasts, usually two or three of these issues are most prevalent. The good news? You can avoid these problems, and the remedies in most cases are fairly obvious. 1. NO SYSTEMATIC PROCESS IN PLACE. There are often two erroneous beliefs that some managers use to justify the absence of a systematic forecasting process. Some say, “Our environment is too unpredictable. We’re growing; we’re going omnichannel; we’re introducing new services; you can’t predict social media interactions … there is no way we can produce an accurate forecast.” Just know, there are many centers in similar situations that are enjoying the benefits of respectably accurate forecasts. Others aren’t convinced that forecasting is worth the time. Yep, it takes time—but not nearly as much as some imagine. Further, a good forecast will save a lot of time later on. 2. AN ASSUMPTION THAT “THE FORECASTING SOFTWARE KNOWS BEST.” If you have forecasting software or a workforce management system, don’t relinquish decisions to the program, assuming that it knows best. The software doesn’t know what the marketing department is about to do, or that average handling time will be affected by changes you are making to processes or systems. Further, it is important to understand the assumptions your forecasting software is making. Some methods are user-definable. For example, you can program the system to give more weight to recent historical data, or you can tell it to ignore data that varies beyond X percent of the norm. It’s a great idea to have the supplier provide a flow chart of the methodology the system is using and decision points where your input is necessary. 3. NOT FORECASTING AT THE AGENT GROUP LEVEL. Even a perfect forecast of the aggregate workload will be of limited use if you route contacts to specialized groups. If you have a group of Mandarin-speaking agents handling services A, B and C, you will need to forecast contacts from Mandarin-speaking customers who need help with those services. 4. THE FORECAST IS TAKEN LIGHTLY. If the forecast has been wildly inaccurate in the past or if no one understands the assumptions used in the process, it will not be given the prominence it needs in the planning steps to follow. 5. EVENTS THAT SHOULD BE EXCEPTIONS BECOME A PART OF THE FORECAST. Utilities tend to get lots of contacts when storms knock out power, the financial industry gets swamped when confusing tax changes are implemented, and many centers have, on at least one occasion, dealt with contacts from an uncoordinated marketing campaign. (Have your agents ever had to sheepishly ask a customer, “Um, what does the promotion say we are offering?”)"
  },
  {
    "page": 104,
    "paragraph": "Those preparing the forecast have to be aware of the root causes of contacts. That will enable better judgment on what is likely to continue (and therefore should be built into the forecast) versus the exceptions. 6. ONGOING COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS DOESN’T EXIST. Most of what happens in a contact center is caused by something going on outside the center. The forecast is doomed if strong ties with other departments don’t exist. 7. PLANNING IS DONE AROUND GOALS, NOT REALITY. If staffing is based on a handling time of four minutes when actual handling time is more like seven minutes, the resulting schedules will be based on a pipe dream. Maybe improved training, streamlined procedures and better systems would move things in that direction. But ignoring reality in the planning process is no way to achieve better results or build confidence in the forecast. 8. NO ONE IS ACCOUNTABLE. As vital as a good forecast is, often there is no one who spearheads the effort. Someone needs to be responsible for bringing the various types of input together, ensuring that it is integrated into the forecast, and investigating which assumptions were off when the forecast is not accurate. 9. AGENTS ARE MIXING FLEXIBLE ACTIVITIES INTO WORK MODES. If agents are not using work modes consistently, especially after-call work, then accurate forecasting will be elusive. 10. NOT MAKING THE CONNECTION WITH STAFFING. Forecasts mean nothing unless they are tied to staff and system resources required. That is the subject of Chapter 7. ✽✽✽ ONE DAY, A LONG TIME AGO As a new manager many years ago, I recall the “pain” of having to deal with a “rogue” product manager who routinely bombarded my contact center with direct marketing campaigns, without giving my team (or me) any advance warning. The product manager, who we’ll call Theresa, had dropped three such campaigns on us the previous month and as you might expect, the results were not pretty: Stressed out agents, angry customers, and a nightmare for our workforce management team, who were valiantly trying to improve our forecasts. When the fourth “mystery” campaign hit the following week, I had Bob, our technology manager, reroute the 1-800 number to Theresa’s direct extension. In less than 10 minutes, I got a call from a distraught Theresa: “What the heck is going on with the 1-800 campaign? How am I supposed to handle these calls?” My reply: “Now you know how we feel!” Things got better quickly. I explained that launching campaigns without properly preparing the contact center was not only stressful for our agents, it also reduced the success of the campaigns and potentially damaged our brand in the eyes of our customers. I’m older and wiser now, and NO, I don’t recommend trying this approach in your own center. It can get you fired! It was, admittedly, the result of both my inexperience and Theresa’s in this area. But it’s a story I tell today because it reinforces the importance something I’ve since stressed for ma"

Rather, they have a group of people (or an individual) who have made accurate forecasting a priority. They have taken responsibility, established good ties across departments, pulled in the data required, and established a forecasting process they are continually improving. They set accuracy goals and monitor progress. And they continue to work on and improve the assumptions they are making when looking ahead. In short, they consider accurate forecasting to be mission-critical. Forecasting takes practice. You will never learn all there is to know about it—but you’ll get better at it. One of the most important steps you can take to improve accuracy is to compare your forecasts with actual results and then ask, “Why?” ✽✽✽ Points to Remember ‣ Forecasting is a blend of art and science, and it incorporates both quantitative and judgmental approaches. ‣ The forecast should accurately predict volume and average handling time. Volume alone is meaningless. ‣ The forecast should reflect adjusted offered calls (the individuals who try to reach you). ‣ There are numerous quantitative forecasting methodologies. Time-series forecasting provides a good foundation for many contact centers. ‣ You need mechanisms, such as a collaborative weekly meeting, to blend judgment into your forecasts. ‣ You need a workload forecast for each agent group. ‣ Accurate forecasts provide a solid foundation for the planning steps that follow."

To calculate how many agents you need to staff for an increment (say, half hour), why not use this formula? Multiply the number of contacts forecasted by average handling time. Then, divide the result by 1,800 seconds (the total seconds in a half hour). You may even build in extra time, such as an added 10 percent or 20 percent, assuming agents will actually need a breather now and then. Or what about this formula? Determine the actual average contacts per agent in a group. Then, divide that into the number of contacts forecasted. Or use target objectives, as in “our agents ought to be able to handle N contacts per half hour; therefore …” These methods may sound logical, and some managers use them. Unfortunately, they are dead wrong. They do not relate the outcome to a target service level. Further, they are based on moving targets. The average group productivity (contacts that the group can handle) is not a constant factor. Instead, it is continually fluctuating because it’s heavily influenced by vacillating workloads and the service level objective. But the biggest problem is that these approaches ignore a fundamental driving force in centers that handle customer-initiated interactions: contacts bunch up! (See Chapter 3.)

The point is, to determine staffing correctly, you need the right tools. You need a method that takes the usual randomness of contact arrival into consideration. That means using the Erlang C formula (or a variation of it) or computer simulation. Staffing the Right Way As introduced in the first chapter, the widely used Erlang C formula was developed in 1917 by A.K. Erlang, a Danish engineer with the Copenhagen Telephone Company. Erlang C can be used to determine resources in just about any situation where people might wait in queue for service—whether it is at a ticket counter, a bank of elevators, or a concessions stand in a stadium. Erlang C (or a variation of it) is currently built into virtually all of the commercially available workforce management software packages. (If you go to Copenhagen, Denmark, you can visit an interesting display on A.K. Erlang’s life and work, in the building in which he used to work. I’ve been there. At the time, I was the only one there … Okay, so it’s not the most popular attraction just yet.) Erlang C calculates predicted waiting times (delay) based on three things: the number of servers (agents); the number of people waiting to be served (customers); and the average amount of time it takes to serve each person. It can also predict the resources required to keep waiting times within targeted limits, and that’s why it is useful for contact centers."
  },
  {
    "page": 109,
    "paragraph": "As with any mathematical formula, Erlang C has built-in assumptions that don’t perfectly reflect real-world circumstances. For one, it assumes that “lost calls are delayed.” In plain English, that means that the formula assumes that customers are queued when no agent is available. No problem with that. The problem is, it assumes that customers have infinite patience —they will wait as long as necessary to reach an agent and nobody will abandon. Oops! Erlang C also assumes that you have infinite trunking and system capacity or that nobody will ever get a busy signal. But busies, rare as they may be in many contact centers, can and do happen. Oops again!"

    "page": 110,
    "paragraph": "The result, in a nutshell, is that Erlang C may overestimate the staff you really need. If some of your customers abandon or get busy signals, your agents won’t have to handle all of the work Erlang C is including in its calculations. Erlang C also assumes that you have the same level of staff handling the workload the entire half hour. In reality, if service level starts taking a nosedive, you may be able to add reinforcements on short notice. ✽✽✽ Advantages and Disadvantages of Erlang C Advantages ✔ Assumes random arrival and that contacts go into queue if an agent is not immediately available ✔ Is accurate at good service levels, where abandoned contacts and busy signals are minimal ✔ Is easy and quick to use, and is available in software programs from a wide variety of sources ✔ Illustrates resource tradeoffs well (e.g., when service level goes up, occupancy goes down) ✔ Is the basis for staffing calculations in most workforce management programs Disadvantages ✘ Assumes no abandoned contacts or busy signals ✘ Assumes “steady-state” arrival, or that traffic does not increase or decrease beyond random fluctuation within the time period ✘ Assumes you have a fixed number of staff handling the work throughout the time period ✘ Assumes that all agents within a group can handle the contacts presented to the group ✘ Calculations assume no contacts in queue from the prior half hour (unless the user or workforce management system makes this adjustment) ✽✽✽ So then why is Erlang C so popular? As you might guess, there are defensible reasons to use it. For one, it’s a planning tool, and most contact centers are planning to have good service levels. Erlang C is fairly accurate for good service levels—and when service level is decent, you should theoretically have little in the way of lost contacts or busy signals. If you do have a lot of contacts abandoning or getting busy signals, it’s probably because you don’t have enough staff to handle the load. In that case, who’s worried about overstaffing? As your staffing more accurately reflects the workload demand, Erlang C will inherently become more accurate. Additionally, if you adjust for abandoned contacts and busy signals (which Erlang C does not do) and retry rates turn out to be higher than you estimate, you could end up underestimating"

There are various simulation packages available (some designed specifically for contact centers and some more generic), and workforce management systems are increasingly providing simulation modules within their applications. But computer simulation has some downsides. For one thing, simulation by itself is designed for modeling, design, and verification, and is generally not meant to be a forecasting and scheduling tool. As a result, if you want the time-saving benefits of software, you will still need a forecasting and scheduling system. Second, simulation software takes more time and expertise to set up and use than Erlang C. Like a flight simulator, you have to run it over and over to identify potential results. That is a phenomenon of its added flexibility, and the time spent will be time saved if you have a complex environment that requires a simulator’s perspective. But it takes more effort and know-how to enter and test variables and interpret the results. So, what should you use?

Let’s look first at calculating base staff for service level contacts, using Erlang C. Service Level One of the advantages of using Erlang C is that it is a great educational tool, and it illustrates queue dynamics and resource tradeoffs well. So, that’s what I’ll be using here to outline basic staffing requirements and tradeoffs for service level, in a contact center setting.

Here’s what the column headings stand for: AGENTS: number of agents required to be plugged in and available to handle contacts. In this example, 34 agents will achieve a service level of 82 percent answered in 20 seconds. P(0): probability of a delay greater than zero seconds. In other words, the probability of not getting an immediate answer. In this example, about 29 percent of contacts will be delayed. That means 71 percent of customers won’t be delayed, but instead will go right to an agent. ASA: average speed of answer. With 34 agents handling calls, ASA will be 13 seconds. ASA is the average delay of all contacts, including the ones that aren’t delayed at all. In this example, 250 contacts are included in the calculation. (See discussion on why ASA is often misinterpreted, Chapter 4.) DLYDLY: average delay of delayed contacts. This is the average delay of those contacts that are delayed—43 seconds, in this example. DLYDLY is a better reflection than ASA of what’s actually happening to the customers that end up in queue. But keep in mind, it’s still an average. Some wait five seconds and others may wait several minutes. If customers end up in queue any amount of time, they will be included in the calculation. Q1: average number of contacts in queue at any time, including times when there is no queue. The label is somewhat of a misnomer, because Q1 incorporates all contacts into the calculation, including those that don’t end up in queue. However, this column makes a useful contrast with the next, Q2. Q2: average number of contacts in queue when all agents are busy or when there is a queue. In the example, an average of six contacts are in queue (when there is a queue). Again, this is an average, and there will sometimes be more than six contacts in queue, sometimes fewer. But this figure can provide useful guidance for what to look for when monitoring real-time information, and it can also be useful for determining overflow parameters. SL: service level, the percentage of contacts that will be answered (meaning, that will reach agents) within the number of seconds you specify (e.g., 82 percent in 20 seconds). OCC: percent agent occupancy. The percentage of time agents will spend handling contacts, including talk time and after-call work. The rest of the time they are available and waiting for contacts. In the example, occupancy will be 86 percent. Notice the tradeoff: when service level goes up, occupancy goes down. We will discuss this dynamic in Chapter 9. TKLD: This colum"

The mechanics of staffing are easy enough. Plug in your numbers and you get some answers. Great! However, the interpretation takes a bit of thought and application. A good question to ask for any service level is, “What happens to the customers that don’t get answered in Y seconds?” Programs that calculate delay can be very useful in answering this question.

Note an important implication of delay: because of random contact arrival, different customers have different experiences even though they contacted the organization during the same half hour and even though the contact center may be hitting its target service level. What’s the worst case that your organization is willing to tolerate? This becomes a key question when exploring these tradeoffs. (Some centers attempt to set two service levels for the same queue: 80 percent of contacts handled within 20 seconds and the rest within 60 seconds. As you can see, that is not possible— 80/20 and 100/60 are distinctly different service levels, and therefore require different staffing levels to achieve.) If you have never used an Erlang C program, we recommend that you get one and experiment with it. You will learn a lot about staffing dynamics and tradeoffs very quickly by using your own numbers and playing a bit of “what if.” What if handling time goes up? What if the number of contacts goes down? What happens to service level if we have fewer agents than required? And so forth—have at it! So far, you have calculated staff required to handle a specified mix of inbound contacts that must be handled when they arrive, for one half hour of the day. You will also need to calculate base staff for each half hour of the day and for every unique group of agents—sales, customer service, or other agent groups you have. In step 6 of the planning and management process, we will discuss how to factor in breaks, absenteeism and other variables that keep agents from the work, so that the schedule (step 7) reflects the total staff you need. Response Time Calculating staff requirements for response time contacts—workload that does not have to be handled at the time it arrives—is typically based on the centuries-old “units of output” approach. Here’s the logic, and let’s use customer email as an example: if you get 60 email messages that have an average handling time of four minutes, that’s four hours of work. One agent working non-stop could handle the load in four hours. If you need to complete the interactions within two hours, you will need a minimum of two agents working over a two-hour period. In other words, the workload and your response time objective dictate staff requirements. The basic formula is as shown. Basic Response Time Formula"
  },
  {
    "page": 118,
    "paragraph": "Volume is the quantity of interactions you must handle, AHT is the average amount of time it takes agents to handle them, and response time is the time you have to respond to customers after receiving their messages. Using the formula, you could handle the 60 messages previously mentioned in two hours with two agents: 60 ÷ (120 ÷ 4) = 2. Here are some things to keep in mind: ▪ You can slice and dice base staff schedules many ways to achieve your objectives. In fact, in the example, you could have 60 agents rush in and handle all 60 interactions just before the promised response time and still meet your objective. What you are really doing is looking for an efficient way to distribute the workload across your schedules within the promised response time. ▪ The basic response time formula assumes a “static” amount of work to be completed—in other words, you have a defined amount of work that has already arrived and is waiting to be processed. However, contacts that can be deferred arrive throughout the day in patterns that are often similar to service level-type traffic. With 24-hour response time objectives, projected workload can simply be built into the following day’s staffing requirements. But if you have more aggressive response time objectives, you’ll need to look at both on-hand workload and projections by interval to determine staffing requirements. ▪ When response time objectives are less than an hour, use Erlang C or computer simulation to calculate base staff. This would be a queuing and service level scenario, like inbound calls. ▪ Breaks, absenteeism and other activities that keep agents from the work need to be added to base staff calculations (a step we’ll cover in Chapter 8). ▪ An “efficiency factor” acknowledges that agents cannot handle one interaction after another with no “breathing” time in between. For example, if you want to build in an efficiency factor with a ceiling of 90 percent, divide base staff calculations by .9 to determine if additional agents are required. In short, meeting response time objectives requires: ▪ Setting response time objectives ▪ Forecasting these interactions, within timeframes specific enough to calculate base staff required"

You may be utilizing skills-based routing, sophisticated network environments or other configurations that go beyond simple agent groups. Your environment will dictate the staffing methodology that will yield the best results. Outbound Contacts There are three general types of outbound contacts. Each has implications for staffing requirements: 1. OUTBOUND THAT IS A PART OF THE INBOUND WORKLOAD. For example, contacts to an emergency roadside service from stranded customers often involve outbound contacts to arrange towing or repair services. Whether these outbound contacts happen during contacts from customers or immediately following the contacts as part of after-call work, they should be considered part of handling time. As such, they should be included in base staff requirements for the inbound workload. 2. OUTBOUND CONTACTS THAT ARE SCHEDULED. In many cases, outbound contacts to customers or prospects can be scheduled based on factors such as convenience to customers, highest probability of making successful connections, etc. Within these blocks of time, outbound contacts can be generated and handled one after another. Base staff requirements can be calculated using traditional response time calculations; for example, a minimum of five agents would be required to handle 20 hours’ worth of contacts in four hours’ time. As with other response time calculations, a reasonable efficiency factor should also be included in the assumptions. 3. OUTBOUND CONTACTS THAT ARE NEITHER A PART OF RANDOMLY ARRIVING INBOUND WORKLOAD NOR SCHEDULED. In every contact center, there are at least some outbound contacts to colleagues or customers that are neither part of the inbound load nor specifically scheduled. If significant enough to merit consideration in resource requirements, they can be reflected in step 6, covered in the next chapter. Skills-Based Routing Available in ACD routing systems since the early 1990s, skills-based routing is a powerful capability designed to match each customer with the agent who has the skill set best suited to handle the contact on a real-time basis. It has been a boon to the efficiency and quality of services provided by centers that, by nature, have overlapping groups or complex routing"

As an example, the maps for a technical support center handling calls across Europe might look like this: MAP 1 ▪ English-speaking customers who need assistance with tablets ▪ English-speaking customers who need assistance with laptops ▪ English-speaking customers who need assistance with printers ▪ English-speaking customers who need assistance with storage devices ▪ French-speaking customers who need assistance with tablets ▪ French-speaking customers who need assistance with laptops"

We used this data to run three different scenarios, all with the same workload and service level objective: ▪ Conventional ACD groups (one group for each contact type) ▪ Skills-based routing ▪ Universal agents (a fully cross-trained group) As the results in the table indicate, skills-based routing is more efficient than separate, segmented groups. Also note that universal agents, where each agent is fully cross-trained and speaks both languages, is the most efficient arrangement. In general, skills-based routing works best in environments that have small groups where multiple skills are required. It has the potential to improve efficiency by matching customers with “just the right agent.” Skills-based routing can also help to integrate new agents in “stages”—for example, they may handle billing calls first, then get additional training on tech support before handling those contacts."

    "paragraph": "Skills-based routing does have some disadvantages. It could be that the agent with just the right skill is on break at the wrong time. Mapping out skills and programming routing scenarios is one thing; getting people in the right place at the right times can be quite another. Small, specialized groups are tough to manage, and they can eliminate the efficiencies of pooling (a principle I’ll cover in Chapter 9) common to more straightforward agent groups. Further, routing and resource planning become more complex. Be prepared to run enough simulations to learn what’s workable in your environment. You also need to develop contingency plans for when the workload of a specific contact type is greater than expected, or when you don’t have the specialized staff you planned for (e.g., because of unplanned absences). And get used to an irony—the most skilled agent may be the most idle, given the usual intent to route contacts to agents with the minimum qualifying skills to handle them (as in the example). Skills-based routing is a powerful capability. But it must be managed well. That means going through the planning process diligently. You’ll need a good forecast and solid staff calculations. Also, remember to work toward pooled groups, to the degree that your circumstances allow. All things being equal, an environment with proficient, cross-trained agents will be the most efficient. ✽✽✽ TROUBLESHOOTING SKILLS-BASED ROUTING Skills-based routing … Intelligent. Flexible. Real-time. The perfect answer to that perennial contact center challenge of getting the right contact to the right place at the right time. At least, that’s the way it’s supposed to work. But in too many cases, skills-based routing also creates difficult new challenges that have wiped out potential benefits. Here are five of the most common problems: STAFF SHRINKAGE. Breaks, lunch, meetings, projects, research, training, absenteeism…you know the story. These things are particularly vexing in a skills-based routing environment where you are trying to get contacts to just the right agents. There’s no substitute for realistically planning and budgeting for the things that keep agents from handling contacts (a subject we’ll cover in Chapter 8)."

    "paragraph": "INACCURATE FORECASTS. The inability to forecast accurately for specific types of skill requirements is the Achilles’ heel of the powerful simulation tools available—and of skills-based routing in general. To anticipate staffing needs, you first need to know how many Spanish-speaking customers you’re going to get between 10:00 and 10:30, how the contact mix will change throughout the day for the expert group handling call types A, B and C, and when your Mandarin Chinese-speaking agents will go on break. Accurate forecasting at this level of specificity takes time and effort. If you’re struggling with the detail, see if it’s possible to combine skills (through hiring and training) to form more manageable agent groups. INACCURATE BASE STAFF CALCULATIONS. Whatever staffing method you use (Erlang C, a variation of it, or simulation), a certain amount of trial and error and a healthy dose of intuition and experience are necessary to accurately model the environment. You will need to run through quite a few (sometimes dozens of) “what-if” scenarios to get it right. POOR ASSUMPTIONS AND RATIONALE. Skills-based routing works best in environments that require many skills and have many possible combinations of skill sets. It can also help to quickly integrate new agents by initially routing only simple contacts or those of a predefined nature to them. What it can’t do is compensate for poor planning, inadequate training or poorly designed information systems. Keep it as simple as possible, and remember that skills-based routing depends on—rather than compensates for the lack of—accurate planning and good processes. NO ROUTING MANAGER/COORDINATOR. If all of this sounds time-consuming, that’s because it is. Even relatively small contact centers have learned through tough, practical experience that it often takes the equivalent of a full-time person to keep skills-based routing running smoothly. Projecting requirements, assessing current capabilities, updating system programming and adjusting staffing plans and schedules to accommodate evolving circumstances are ongoing activities. ✽✽✽ Network Environments Network environments, like skills-based routing, can introduce complex contingencies into staffing calculations. The method you use for calculating staff will depend on the type of network environment you have. Your contacts can be routed in different ways. Some examples include: VIRTUAL CONTACT CENTER. In a true virtual environment, each contact is routed to the first available agent (or longest-waiting agent). Other routing and queuing contingencies (such as skills-based routing) notwithstanding, this environment represents a traditional agent group regardless of where agents are located (at home, across campus, or on the other side of the world), and Erlang C will generally produce accurate calculations.

The criteria that determine how contacts are interflowed can run the gamut, from availability at each site to the types of contacts you are handling. For example, you might immediately send high-priority contacts to available agents in any site, but queue all other contacts longer for the intended agent group. Simulation can help to model and test the environment under different conditions. PERCENT ALLOCATION. With this traditional approach—less common now than more sophisticated alternatives—routing is set up to allocate contacts among sites. For example, you may program 40 percent of contacts to be routed to one site, 35 percent to a second, and the"

As with agent groups in a single site, you will forecast the workload you anticipate and run Erlang C calculations for agent groups in each site. There are many variations, and (you’ll find this no surprise by now) I always feel more comfortable when someone shows me the specific parameters that determine how contacts are routed. I remember making a spine-tingling discovery one time with the help of another consultant. By mapping out network routing parameters step-by-step, we isolated why, on rare occasions, contacts to a crisis line were ending up in voice mail. It was never supposed to happen, but by going through call flow, step-by-step, we were able to isolate the problem. It was a good day. The underlying principle is simple: staff appropriately for how and where you intend contacts to be handled. And, as with skills-based routing and other alternatives, keep it simple enough so that you and your team can manage it. Long Contacts Contacts that take a relatively long time to handle pose another staffing challenge. Thirty- minute reporting periods provide an adequate level of detail and accuracy for most contact centers. However, some centers, particularly those in technical support environments, handle contacts with long average handling times—defined as those that exceed 20 minutes. When long contacts are not distributed as Erlang C anticipates, they may violate the assumptions of the formula. Compounding the problem is the fact that some ACDs count contacts in the period in which they begin, but report average handling time in the period in which they end. Consequently, reported averages can be skewed. If your AHT approaches or exceeds 20 minutes, you may need to adjust your default reporting interval to an hour. Most Erlang C programs will allow you to define the interval you want to use. Alternatively, you can program a simulator to model the mix of contacts you are handling. If, on the other hand, long contacts are not common, but they do occasionally occur, you will need to adjust your statistics (remove them from assumptions) before using your historical data. You will also need to consider how you manage long contacts. Most technical support environments have a second tier of support to handle complex issues. You will need to manage the service level for both tiers, or it will suffer in both. But when managed well, this approach can ensure that longer contacts don’t tie up the primary group and cause erratic service levels. Peaked Traffic Peaked traffic, as discussed in Chapter 3, is a surge beyond random variation within a half hour, which poses a unique staffing challenge. For the purposes of this discussion, there are two types of peaked traffic—the type you can plan for and those incidents that are impossible to predict."

Similarly, if a national news program unexpectedly provides your contact information to the viewing audience as part of a story, you will get unannounced peaked traffic —and it will be quite an experience! The problem is, you can’t predict these events, and you’re probably not willing to staff up for them just in case they happen. So staffing for unexpected peaks falls more in the category of real-time management or disaster recovery planning. On the other hand, peaked traffic that you are expecting belongs squarely in the realm of planning. Forecasting, staffing, and scheduling to meet a specified service level still apply. However, planning must happen at much more detailed periods of time, often in 5- or 10-minute increments. For a given service level, peaked traffic requires more staff than random traffic, and agents will have a lower occupancy over a half-hour period."

Alternatively, some staffing programs allow you to specify the timeframe you choose, and can accommodate short intervals. But common sense is required.

The last 50 customers will have to wait something like two times the average handling time of the contacts. The situation is similar to a bus dropping people off in front of a sports arena. Those reaching the ticket booths first get quick service. For others, wait times can be dramatically different, depending on where they end up in the line. Consequently, how peaked the traffic is (how concentrated it is within a small period of time) and the sequence in which specific customers arrive will dramatically impact service level. Use common sense as you think through these scenarios, and take steps to ensure your customers don’t spend too long in queue. Chat Let’s turn to interactions with multiple back-and-forth messages between a customer and agent. Chat is the most common, but the same considerations apply to channels with similar characteristics (e.g., some text and social media interactions). Chat is a service-level-oriented contact, and the essential planning steps apply. You can determine the most conservative (highest) estimate of agents you’ll need by assuming that each agent can interact with only one customer at a time, then using Erlang C or simulation to calculate staff requirements based on the usual input—number of contacts, average session transaction time (the equivalent of AHT), and your service level objective. You’ll then adjust for (divide by) the average number of concurrent sessions your agents handle. As we’ll see, though, workflow-routing and handling options lead to different staffing requirements. Terms Let’s review some important terms. The following are definitions that we use and recommend. (Note that, depending on the application, the roles may be reversed—the agent may make an initial request to a customer browsing the organization’s website.) SESSION: The whole of the interaction, from hello to goodbye EXCHANGE: A part of a session that begins with an inquiry from the customer and concludes with a response from the agent SESSION RESPONSE TIME: The time it takes the organization to respond to the initial request for a session from the customer EXCHANGE RESPONSE TIME: The time that elapses between the customer sending a question or comment and the delivery of the agent’s response CUSTOMER RESPONSE TIME: The time it takes the customer to read an agent’s reply and send a response EXCHANGE HANDLE TIME: The time it takes for the agent to prepare and deliver a response during an exchange"

They include: WHEN WILL YOU NEED FORMAL PLANNING? While some organizations use chat extensively, it makes up a relatively small portion of the contact workload for many others. If you’re just starting out, you’ll need to answer a fundamental question: When do you move from “educated guessing” to staffing approaches that are more scientific? After all, if you only need one or two agents handling chat, advanced mathematical approaches won’t yield any more accuracy than common sense. ICMI recommends that a sensible threshold is five—when you need five or more agents handling chat at any one time, a more disciplined approach will begin to pay off. (This is also a sensible threshold for social media and other types of interactions.) HOW MANY CONCURRENT SESSIONS ARE FEASIBLE? Another key decision is around the number of simultaneous sessions you allow agents to handle. Systems can be configured to enable 16 or more simultaneous sessions per agent—which, of course, is impractical from a human standpoint. The number of maximum concurrent sessions you allow will impact response times, average handling times, customer satisfaction, accuracy, and employee morale. To determine how far beyond one session at a time you can move, basic math comes in handy. Assume that you set the maximum number of concurrent sessions at five (too many for most, but let’s go with it for this example). It’s simple and valuable to develop worst-case estimates. Here’s the formula: Multiply the maximum number of concurrent sessions you expect by the average exchange handle time. The result will give you an idea of what could happen (worst case) to customer wait times. For example, if five customers initiate an exchange at the same time, and the average exchange handle time is 1.25 minutes, the last customer in line will have to wait 6.25 minutes for a response (5 × 1.25). This scenario won’t happen often. But if and when it does, the delay would be well beyond the expectations of most customers. So, five concurrent sessions would be too high for an organization focused on delivering high levels of service. My advice to those just starting out: Go with no more than one or two until you get a better read on what’s possible and get the kinks worked out of the system. Overstating the number of concurrent sessions will leave you short-staffed. Consultant Jay Minnucci adds another important consideration: some organizations will only do one chat at a time, for fear of an agent"

    "paragraph": "accidentally providing one customer’s information to another. WHEN DO AGENTS RECEIVE A SESSION? Another decision you must make is when an agent will receive a session. If a customer’s initial request is immediately delivered to an agent, you can send an automated, personalized greeting from that agent to the customer. If you decide to delay routing to the agent, you will need to deliver either a blank chat box or one with a generic greeting. Here’s the staffing tradeoff: If you provide the more personalized approach, you will need to live with the chance that you may be tying up an agent too early—some customers will request a chat session but then never initiate the exchange, and the agent will be left waiting for a question that never comes. Given this possibility, you will probably want to allow relatively more concurrent sessions per agent than in a scenario where an agent is selected only after an exchange is initiated. WHEN DOES A SESSION END? You will also need to define when a session ends. Often, the point of close-out is clear—but sometimes it’s not. For example, customers may get what they need and ignore further attempts at communication; they may step away from their computer or device; or they might head off to a competitor’s site. (Chat is often perceived to be less personal than calls, and customers may apply different rules of courtesy.) While your agent waits for a response, the session is considered active. So you’ll need to decide on procedures to try to re-engage the customer, and when the agent can, in effect, “give up” and close the session. Staffing implication: The longer the threshold until close-out, the more time the agent will spend waiting for an exchange that may never occur; accordingly, a long threshold would suggest you can allow a relatively higher number of concurrent sessions per agent. In short, staffing for chat revolves more around questions of workflow and technology application than on mathematical calculations. As volumes rise, you’ll need to make decisions in each of these areas that are right for your customers. Chat Reports Although concurrent chat sessions can improve productivity, they can also make reporting more difficult. Consider again the example of five concurrent sessions, where all five customers initiate an exchange at the same time. The last customer served will have to wait 6.25 minutes for a response—but most of that time was spent on other exchanges with other customers. The reporting challenge is accounting for these variables. For example, when a customer initiates an exchange, the reporting system must note how many concurrent exchanges are already in queue for that agent in order to determine the exchange handle time. The customer who is fourth in line will wait a total of five minutes for a response. Divide that wait time by the number of exchanges in queue, and you’ll come up with the exchange handle time of 1.25 minutes (5 ÷ 4). But you can see that reporting must account for ma"

Social Media and Text For staffing purposes, there are different types of social media interactions, each requiring a specific approach to resource planning. Text, direct messages through social platforms, or in-app messaging have similar considerations. Here are some common variations: REAL-TIME INTERACTIONS, WITH SINGLE RESPONSE. In this setting, the organization handles interactions through social media channels as they occur, with one response generally being sufficient. Typical examples include responding to customers with numbers they can contact, specific email addresses, or links to online resources that provide necessary information. These are service level-type interactions, and the staffing approach is like that for inbound calls. REAL-TIME INTERACTIONS, WITH MULTIPLE EXCHANGES. In this case, the organization strives to handle interactions when they are initiated, and the dialogue often involves multiple back-and-forth messages. Once engaged, customers may continue to ask questions or seek clarification. These are service level-type contacts with staffing considerations like those of chat (see discussion on chat, above). INTERACTIONS THAT CAN BE DEFERRED. This approach involves addressing inquires or issues that do not require an immediate response. Common examples include responding to general inquiries posted through social media sites, or sending responses, FAQ documents, or relevant links that address questions posted in forums. In this scenario, staffing is response time-oriented, like that for email or scheduled outbound contacts. INTERNAL INTERACTIONS. The impact of internal collaboration tools on staffing requirements must be considered in context. If internal communication is necessitated by (and happens while) handling customer interactions, the time required should be reflected realistically in the average handling time associated with those contacts. On the other hand, internal communication that is not directly associated with handling customer contacts (e.g., for internal projects or, simply, the everyday communication that is part of a normal work environment) should at least be accounted for in overall schedule requirements (see Chapter 8). Note that different systems will deliver social media interactions to agents in different ways. For example, some present social interactions in email-like format. That’s fine. Just remember, it’s not email in the usual sense, and staffing requirements should be driven by whether the work needs to happen at the time and whether it involves multiple exchanges. Considerations for text messages (those that involve agents) are similar—do they occur at the time of initial inquiry (requiring a service level approach) or can they happen later (response time)? And, are they generally handled in one response (like a call) or"

    "paragraph": "Whew! All the variables in staffing are a lot to think about. Omnichannel environments, depending on how you route and queue contacts, can include any combination of channels and contact types. You’ll want to consider both customer experience and the ability of your agents to handle different channels and workload. Given the variables and increasing variety in today’s workloads, you and your team have a lot to think about. But take heart: Getting staffing right is something you get better at with practice. It gets easier. And you can always make adjustments as you go along. Staffing goes to the heart of what contact centers have always excelled at: matching up supply and demand in real time. Remember that when all is said and done, success is more important than perfection. Trunks and System Resources Along with staffing, you’ll need sufficient trunks and system resources. And there’s an important relationship to understand: trunking (the lines or bandwidth capacity you need) must be calculated with an understanding of staffing requirements. Staffing impacts delay, which affects the load that systems and networks must carry. If you are thanking your lucky stars that you have an IT/telecom department to worry about system issues, and, frankly, never wanted to know about trunks and certainly not any relationship between staff and trunks … I do understand. But stick with me on this. Understanding the underlying dynamics is important and will serve you well, even if you’re not the one doing the calculations. Calls Let’s look at a few basic definitions. We’ll consider them in a traditional context (e.g., a trunk as a line required to carry a conversation). When interpreting the diagram, Progression of a Customer Call, assume inbound calls entering a “straight-in” environment, where customers dial a number and are routed directly to the agent group. For our simple example, let’s assume no IVR (“Press or say one for…”) is involved."

    "paragraph": "DELAY: Delay is everything from when the trunk is seized to the point at which the customer is connected to an agent. AGENT LOAD: Agent load includes the two components of handling time—talk time and after-call work. TRUNK LOAD: Trunk load includes all aspects of the interaction other than after-call work, which does not require a trunk. The “caller’s load” is the same as the trunk load, other than the short time it takes for the network to route the call to the contact center. Notice that agent load and trunk load both include talk time. However, trunk load carries the delay, which is not a direct part of the agent load. And the agents handle after-call work, which is not carried by the trunks. The more staff handling a given call load, the less delay callers will experience. In other words, staffing impacts delay; therefore, it directly impacts the trunking capacity that is required."

    "paragraph": "Calculations As you consider trunks and related system resources, let’s start with the assumption that you need a trunk (a line, a path) for each simultaneous conversation (we’ll then look at how that might not be the case). More specifically, you need enough trunks to carry the delay that customers experience (the time from the moment contacts arrive at the routing system until they reach agents) and the conversation time (talk time), for the period you are analyzing. The general method for calculating trunks is as follows: 1. Forecast the workload to be handled for the busiest half hour in the foreseeable future. 2. Compute the number of agents required to handle the forecasted workload at your service level objective. 3. Determine the trunk load according to the workload you will be handling and the service level you can realistically achieve. The trunk load represents “erlangs”—hours of traffic in an hour (how much time, in hours, customers are in queue or connected to agents over an hour). 4. Determine the number of trunks required to handle the calculated trunk load, using (typically) Erlang B. Erlang B or variations of it (yep, also the work of our beloved Danish engineer) is widely used and is often available in workforce management programs or in resource calculators (including QueueView, the program that I am using for examples). With any of the usual formulas used for calculating trunks, you will need to specify the probability of busy signals you can live with; if you input zero, you’ll need as many trunks as there are calls.

You will probably have other variables to consider. For example, most contact centers have an IVR system that customers go through before they reach an agent (e.g., to enter their account number, route themselves, authenticate through voice biometrics, and other applications). If so, these requirements will need to be factored into the calculations. It is also a consideration if trunk capacity is shared across agent groups or the broader organization. When all is said and done, you’ll need adequate bandwidth to support the busiest foreseeable increments in your “universe.” Workload demands will also drive other system requirements: IVR capacity, chatbots, how you engineer your network, the resources you’ll need for backup in case of disaster, etc. The underlying engineering principles are the same.

    "paragraph": "A ccurate scheduling—getting the right people in the right places at the right times—is more important than ever. It’s also more difficult. Most contact centers are supporting a broader range of products and services than in the past. They’re handling that work through more channels. And as self-service and AI-enabled capabilities evolve, the work requiring agents is inherently more complex. It’s also more important to customers and the experiences they have. Internally, there are more things pulling at agents’ time. In most cases, there are more requirements governing employment (time off, leave policies, etc.). At a deeper level, employees across all generations want to be involved in work that is interesting and meaningful and that supports their lifestyles. The mandate: get schedules right or brace for chaos. Fortunately, the principles of effective scheduling have not changed. With a collaborative approach and practice, you get good at it. And you get buy-in that supports your culture and ensures everyone is pulling in the right direction. From one perspective, a schedule is a high-level forecast. It incorporates all of the planning steps discussed in previous chapters and predicts who needs to be where, doing what and when. It is also a “game plan,” designed specifically for individuals and a team to follow (though like any plan, it may need to be revisited as the game unfolds). The Scheduling Challenge Before we head into the next two planning steps (step 6 and step 7), let’s take stock of where you are in the planning process. You chose service level and response time objectives (step 1), acquired the necessary planning data (step 2), and forecasted the workload associated with the various types of work you must handle (step 3). You then calculated base staff and system resources required (steps 4 and 5)."

So, scheduling for an average half hour of the day, average day of the week or average month of the year will mean being either overstaffed or understaffed much of the time. Consequently, schedules need to reflect the workload as it changes throughout the day, week and year."

We’ll cover longer-term staff planning and budgeting in Chapter 10. Short-term execution is at the other end of the spectrum. You can accurately forecast the workload, know how many people you need and schedule accordingly, yet still miss your service level and response time objectives by a long shot because your agents aren’t in the right places at the right times. We’ll look at schedule adherence in Chapter 14. Accounting for Shrinkage Have you ever looked at a supervisor monitor or walked the floor and wondered, “Where is everybody?” I have a hunch that every contact center manager has asked that question at one time or another! Part of the answer is schedule adherence. But another part is realistically anticipating the things that can occupy agents’ time."

It is calculated after base staffing is determined and before schedules are organized. RSF is a form of forecasting. The major assumption is that the proportion of staff away from handling contacts will be consistent. In other words, if one person is on break in a group of 10, 10 people will be on break in a group of 100. An illustration of how to calculate RSF is shown in the table. The mechanics include five steps: Rostered Staff Factor (Shrinkage) Calculation"

  {
    "page": 140,
    "paragraph": "1. ENTER THE BASE STAFF REQUIRED BY INTERVAL. What is included in base staff depends on the structure of your groups. For example, if you have separate agent groups for different contact channels, the base staff entered represents one of those groups. You will need RSF calculations for each group. On the other hand, if you set up groups that handle both categories of contacts as the example shows (service level and response time), base staff is first calculated for both types of work separately and then added together. You then calculate RSF for the combined group. 2. IDENTIFY THE THINGS THAT ROUTINELY KEEP AGENTS FROM THE WORKLOAD. The next three columns reflect the number of agents absent, on break or in training, in your current environment. These categories are just a few examples; you can also include research, projects, and other activities. You may also want to further subdivide the categories. For example, absenteeism can be divided into planned absenteeism (such as vacations) and unplanned absenteeism (such as sick leave). 3. ADD BASE STAFF TO THE NUMBER OF AGENTS WHO WILL BE AWAY FROM THE WORKLOAD, FOR EACH HALF HOUR. The “on-schedule” column is the sum of the entries in the previous columns, by half hour. 4. CALCULATE RSF. The last column is derived by dividing the staff required on schedule by base staff required for each half hour. For example, look at the 8:00-8:30 half-hour. There are 22 base staff (agents) required, but 24 needed on the schedule. 24 divided by 22 gives a factor of 1.09. The proportions are the mechanism you will use to project future schedule requirements. 5. USE THE FACTORS WHEN ORGANIZING FUTURE SCHEDULES.

    "paragraph": "example, if you are putting together a schedule for four weeks from now, and you project a requirement of 32 base staff between 8:30 and 9:00, you will need to schedule 40 agents (32 × 1.25) for that half hour—plus a margin for staff that will be working on projects, in meetings, or doing anything else not included in the calculation. I recommend that you initially produce a table of factors for each day of the week and for each agent group you will be scheduling. Then, adjust the calculations as circumstances dictate, such as for vacation season or major changes in training schedules. What to Include While breaks and absenteeism should always be included in RSF calculations, other activities require some analysis and judgment. For example, should training be included? If training schedules frequently change or require differing proportions of staff, keep training out of calculations and, instead, factor it into schedules on a case-by-case basis. But if training happens in predictable proportion to the base staff required, include it. Note: after-call work is already included in base staff calculations (as part of average handling time) so it should not be included in RSF factor calculations. In many contact centers, RSF ebbs and flows in the 1.1 to 1.5 range throughout the day, meaning that a minimum of 10 percent to 50 percent additional staff are required on schedule, compared to base staff (agents handling the workload). But don’t trust rules of thumb: You will need to produce your own calculations. If activities not related to the workload are significant, RSF can be as high as 2.0, meaning that you’ll need to schedule two people for each agent required. This is fairly common in some technical support environments that require more extensive offline research. Improving Accuracy Larger centers will pick up accuracy by going through this planning step in 15-minute increments. In smaller centers, half-hour periods are sufficient, but you should use numbers that are conservative (err on the side of overstaffing). For example, if you have two people on break the first 15 minutes of the half hour, and four on break in the second half of the period, use four in the calculations. If you calculated staff for hour increments due to long calls (as discussed in Chapter 6), you can also generally calculate RSF by hour, since long contacts tend to impact scheduled breaks and lunch. If you find that hours are not picking up the activity accurately, drop to half-hour increments. If you are handling peaked traffic, you can usually use half-hour or 15-minute increments for RSF even though you calculated base staff for even shorter periods. (Naturally, plan any activities that are flexible around the inbound peaks.) Shrinkage or Rostered Staff Factor?

    "paragraph": "reality of needing more staff on schedule than the base staff (agents) required to handle customer contacts. There’s nothing wrong with that, as long as it’s understood that the terms refer to the overall concept of needing more staff on schedule than the base staff required to handle the workload. Others use the terms more specifically—nothing wrong with that either, as long as the context is understood. When differentiated—and it’s subtle—shrinkage refers to how much loss (shrinkage) there is between scheduled staff and base staff, while rostered staff factor looks at how much needs to be added to base staff required to reach schedule requirements. What’s not subtle is how the calculations for each are used when they are differentiated in this way. Consider an example where base staff is 40 and 10 agents will be involved in other activities. The schedule requirement is 50 agents. The RSF is 50/40, or 1.25 Application: 40 × 1.25 = 50 agents (or) The shrinkage (loss) = 10/50, or 20% Application: 40 ÷ (1 - 20%) = 50 agents Uh oh … you can probably see what’s coming here. Some mistakenly apply shrinkage in place of what should be RSF and end up with too few scheduled agents; others use RSF in place of what should be shrinkage and end up with too many scheduled agents. Investment analysts often have to remind clients of a similar principle in the world of finance. If a $5,000 investment drops by 20 percent, the new balance is $4,000; $4,000 would need to grow by 25 percent (4,000 × 1.25) to again reach $5,000. Many contact center managers have found themselves in a similar education process: “Yes, scheduled staff shrinks by 20 percent, which is why we need 25 percent additional staff above base staff requirements for that increment!” In that respect, RSF has some advantages—it’s easier to explain. Correctly applying either method at the interval level will lead you to the same answers. However, you have to take shrinkage a step further to calculate staff required, while RSF provides requirements more directly. The RSF methodology also tends to fit nicely into the logical progression of planning: calculate staff and supporting resources (steps 4 and 5), determine and apply RSF (step 6), and organize schedules (step 7). Shrinkage tends to take a more circuitous route, starting with schedules (step 7), then determining loss or shrinkage (step 6), then applying the formula to base staff and supporting resources (steps 4 and 5), all to get back to schedule requirements (step 7). It’s a small but important point, and I do prefer the RSF approach when explaining these principles to others."

    "paragraph": "Shrinkage does have some advantages. It’s the term that, more often than not, has been adapted by workforce optimization systems. (I run into people who have been in the profession for years and have never heard of RSF.) And it’s used more broadly in other business settings, such as where grocers must account for inventory loss caused by damage or food expiration. Finally, the time horizon you are considering may impact the approach you use. As described here, RSF and shrinkage are for near- and medium-term scheduling purposes. When we look at a longer planning horizon, we’ll use a shrinkage-like approach to determine full-time equivalent requirements (Chapter 10). But caution is in order: Any mismatch of time—i.e., taking a calculation for shrinkage or RSF determined over a broader timeframe, and applying it to smaller increments—simply doesn’t work. There are different ways to get from point A to point B. When used correctly and in the right context, both shrinkage and RSF lead to the same answer. ✽✽✽ CAN YOU SKIP STEP 6? Why bother with RSF—step 6 in the planning process—if you know how many staff you will need simply by adding the columns together? Better yet, why bother with any of it, if your scheduling software accounts for these sorts of things? Can you calculate base staff requirements, then jump right into scheduling—skipping step 6 altogether? With workforce management systems, you can, in a sense, do just that. After calculating base staff requirements, you will begin building schedules. And yes, they will account for and include breaks, holidays, training and any other variables you enter. But step 6 is still important, for several reasons: ▪ Simply understanding the principle is key to understanding the spread between base staff and schedule requirements. And you’ll need to explain this issue to others in various planning and budgeting settings. ▪ There will be times when you’ll want to model the schedule requirements for different workload scenarios, without laboring though the minutia of adding up individual components. There’s nothing that beats the speed and accuracy of having a set of factors. ▪ Because it is a ratio, RSF can be easily tracked and graphed, enabling you to see relative trends and identify improvement opportunities. That is much more difficult when looking at a full-blown schedule. ✽✽✽ A Prerequisite to Effective Budgets and Schedules Frankly, the whole notion of rostered staff factor raises lots of questions in the budgeting process—and understandably so. You’ll hear something like, “You mean to tell me we need to hire 42 people so we can have 30 handling the work?” Well … yes.

This is also a great opportunity to reinforce the contact center’s unique, time-sensitive environment. RSF calculations can be a valuable part of communicating budget requirements (we’ll cover long term staffing in Chapter 10). An added advantage of making this effort is that it will force you to examine these activities. Should they be happening when and to the degree that they are? Even small changes may provide better coverage or make scheduling easier or more acceptable to agents. Like any aspect of planning, examine how accurate your predictions are compared to actual results, and adjust accordingly. After you have calculated RSF, you know your staffing requirements accurately down to specific times of day. The next challenge is to identify scheduling alternatives and parameters so that you can organize schedules that closely match staffing requirements. Scheduling Alternatives Considering that staffing needs fluctuate significantly throughout the day, month, and year, what can you do to ensure you have an adequate number of people in place without being overstaffed much of the time? After all, few would want to work half-hour shifts. Fortunately, quite a few alternatives exist and we’ll summarize many of them here. Not all will be feasible for you. This aspect of planning is creative—it involves putting all options on the table, identifying the scheduling approaches that could work in your environment, and then making a decision on those that you will use. USE HIRING TO YOUR ADVANTAGE. Important criteria when hiring new agents should be the hours and days they, in general can be available to work. UTILIZE CONVENTIONAL SHIFTS. Most organizations have a core group of agents who work a traditional five-day week with shifts during normal hours (e.g., 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). That’s just fine, assuming there are additional scheduling options to address variability in workload within and beyond these hours."

    "paragraph": "ADJUST BREAKS, LUNCH, COACHING, AND TRAINING SCHEDULES. Even slight changes to when these activities are scheduled can mean that more people are handling contacts at just the right times. That can make a big difference (see Chapter 9). Some managers find that scheduling breaks and lunches on the 5-minute mark (e.g., 10:05, 10:10) helps—they won’t happen that precisely in reality, but this can lessen the impact of simultaneous events. Within reason, this alternative is available to any organization. STAGGER SHIFTS. For example, one shift begins at 7 a.m., the next at 7:30 a.m., the next at 8 a.m., etc., until the center is fully staffed for the busy mid-morning traffic. This is a common and effective approach. Be sure to tweak these shifts as necessary to account for changes in workload patterns. OFFER CONCENTRATED SHIFTS. Given the choice, some employees will opt to work fewer days with more hours per day, while others would rather work fewer hours in a day, even if that means a six- or seven-day workweek. But keep in mind that not all agents can perform at high levels throughout extended shifts. USE AN ENVELOPE STRATEGY. With more types of work to handle in today’s environment, many contact centers are using an “envelope” strategy (see figure)—meaning there’s a larger envelope of staff scheduled than generally required by customer contacts alone. This approach recognizes that some types of work have to be handled at specific times of the day, and other types of work allow more flexibility. The idea is to move in and out of the various"

However, overtime can be expensive as an ongoing strategy and, once again, there is the question of whether or not agents can sustain high performance over longer shifts. GIVE AGENTS THE OPTION TO GO HOME WITHOUT PAY. Many organizations provide LWOP (leave without pay, pronounced “el-wop”) or VTO (voluntary time off) when workloads slow down. (This is also common outside of contact centers, such as in warehouse facilities). There are agents willing to take you up on it, but you’ll learn with some experience how practical this approach is. SCHEDULE PART-TIMERS. Some centers are prevented from using part-time help by union agreements or by practicalities, such as complex services requiring extensive training. But when available and feasible, this is a popular and common approach. I’m seeing more organizations use Uber-like scheduling and surge pay to cover high demand around holidays and off-hour shifts. ESTABLISH REINFORCEMENTS. When contact-handling duties are combined with other tasks, such as correspondence or data entry, the agents assigned to these collateral duties can act as reinforcements when the workload gets heavy.

This approach takes the reinforcement method to the larger organization, where employees from other areas help handle customer services as needed. To implement this alternative successfully, you’ll need to address training, scheduling, pay and cultural issues. ARRANGE FOR SOME AGENTS TO BE ON CALL. Although this option is impractical for many, it can work in situations where events cannot be precisely predicted (e.g., retailers during the initial days of a new promotion). Typically, for it to be effective, agents must be equipped to work from home. OFFER SPLIT SHIFTS. Granted, split shifts—where agents work a partial shift, take part of the day off, then return later to finish their shifts—are not common. We’ve seen them in situations where university students are employed and work around class schedules. But don’t count this alternative out in other settings. A group of full-time employees in one of MetLife’s contact centers once volunteered to work in the mornings and then come back for the less popular evening shift. They were happy to have some free midday time for errands and leisure activities. GET HELP FROM AN OUTSOURCER. Today, outsourcers of all types and capabilities are available. The better among them can handle complex contacts, and many focus on specific industries, languages, and contact channels. With some, the capacity to quickly ramp up as workloads dictate is a key advantage. COLLABORATE WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. Some centers have formed successful staffing alliances with other organizations. With different seasonality patterns, two centers can “lend” agents to one another to help each company effectively handle peak contact periods and minimize costs that would be incurred to hire and train temporary staff. While not a common practice, we have seen organizations from diverse industries use this staff-sharing approach successfully. ESTABLISH HOME-BASED AGENTS. This is not a scheduling alternative per se, but it can make unpopular shifts more tolerable and allow agents to handle contacts on short notice. Numerous organizations have successfully implemented work-at-home agent programs, benefiting not only from enhanced scheduling flexibility but also increased productivity and agent retention. Some companies have arranged for the majority of contact center staff to be home agents. SACRIFICE SERVICE LEVEL FOR A PLANNED PERIOD OF TIME. It may be unrealistic for some customer service or technical support centers to meet service level (and response time) objectives during the initial weeks of a new product introduction or during the busiest season.

Here are some examples: ▪ JetBlue, American Express, and Omni Hotels and Resorts are among the many organizations using at-home agents extensively, which opens up many flexible scheduling alternatives. Home-agent programs have skyrocketed in the last decade, enabled by advancements in technologies, the desirability of flexible work arrangements (which increases the pool of qualified staff), disaster backup considerations (e.g., inclement weather), and cost efficiencies. ▪ The healthcare industry sees workload spikes each year during open enrollment, and an off-season period that can be very slow. This, coupled with annual training periods of up to 12 weeks, makes staffing a challenge. Humana, UnitedHealthcare and others in the space are responding with combinations of a teacher model (i.e., off some of the summer), voluntary time off, and reduced shifts during the off-peak. ▪ Agents with U.S. Bancorp Fund Services can change their shift pattern preferences weekly. For example, they can select a standard 5×8 shift (five days, eight hours); 4×10, which provides an extra day off; 10, 10, 8, 8, 4, which provides a half day off; or others. Similarly, Vegas.com, Zappos and others are enabling agents to schedule their own shifts (often through mobile apps) around blocks of time that match forecasted requirements.

My favorite long-running example is The Vanguard Group, the financial services company that pioneered a “SWAT team” that they call their Swiss Army. Employees up to and including (in his time) the late founder and former CEO, John C. Bogle, have helped handle customer interactions. Yes, that helps with the workload—and it’s also a powerful reinforcement of what matters (being there for customers). ✽✽✽ Sometimes I hear defeatist attitudes related to staffing and scheduling: “Hey, they’re going to give us what they are going to give us.” (See chart, Someone Who Has Given Up.) But there are many scheduling alternatives available, even in relatively restrictive environments. Further, would senior management be persuaded by budgetary requests based on solid planning? The answer is usually an unequivocal “yes.” Someone Who Has Given Up"

    "paragraph": "Putting the Pieces Together Scheduling is, by nature, an iterative process. Effective scheduling will always involve a certain amount of trial and error. As you identify scheduling alternatives, there are a number of important considerations: AGENT PREFERENCES. If you involve agents in identifying scheduling possibilities up front, they will often generate ideas you didn’t consider and will better accept and adhere to the schedules that are produced. Scheduling modules that provide the ability for agents to directly create, swap and adjust schedules (within established parameters) are popular with agents and workforce managers alike. And education on the implications of service level, quality, and the impact of each person helps enormously (see The Power of One, Chapter 9). AGENT GROUP STRUCTURE AND CHANNEL MIX. How specialized are your skill requirements? Some centers can’t say with precision where contacts go because their skills- or contingency-based routing environments are so complex. Keep your routing contingencies simple enough to manage. Similarly, what’s your channel mix, and how does that (and should that) impact your agent group structure? With these issues in mind, invest the time necessary to forecast, staff and schedule for the unique mix of contacts your center is handling. SCHEDULE HORIZON. How far in advance will you determine schedules (the schedule horizon)? If you schedule further out, say for two or three months from now, your schedules will be less efficient. They will be locked in place, even if the workloads deviate from the forecast. But a big plus is that they will be more agreeable to your staff, who prefer to know their work schedules well in advance. On the other hand, if you use a shorter timeframe, the scheduling process will be less popular with agents, but schedules will likely be more accurate. This issue is a balancing act."

    "paragraph": "UNION, LEGAL, AND CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS. You will need to carefully consider union, legal and any specific contractual requirements to ensure that you are scheduling within acceptable parameters. Restrictions on part-time staff and temporary staff, hours worked and overtime pay will impact the alternatives you can use. If you are a union-based shop, an open, collaborative environment with union representatives—as well as educating all involved on the principles covered in Chapters 7 through 9—can help immensely. Scheduling software can be a big help in shuffling the pieces and generating schedules according to the parameters you establish. Conversely, it can produce schedules that people will look at and say, “Are you kidding? There’s no way we can adhere to that.” So you’ll need to define the rules and manage the process for best results. As in other aspects of planning, you’ll need to make sure that the software is considering all of the alternatives and parameters unique to your environment. You will also need to be realistic about agent preferences and encourage their involvement. In short, this, like other planning steps, should be a collaborative effort; and it involves a great deal more than mechanics. How Did It Go? Want to really know how well scheduling is going? Make a line graph of your service level as it was during a recent week (you can also do this for response time). The following charts represent agent groups in three different contact centers. Because these graphs display actual results by half hour (not results for a single day or averages for a week or month), they can expose recurring problem areas. (Note: the hours and days of operation are different for each, as are their service level objectives, represented by the straight lines near the top of each chart. Each example represents a specific week.)"

You are striving for a fairly consistent, on-target service level such as this. Yes, it looks a bit variable, but because service level is a high-level report, these graphs won’t show stable, repeating patterns usually inherent to handling time or volume graphs. The next graph illustrates a service level that…um…isn’t so hot. You can see that service level is relatively consistent from day to day but well below the organization’s objective of answering 75 percent of contacts in 20 seconds. It dips mid-morning, mid-afternoon, and around lunchtime, probably as the result of breaks and lunch."

My hunch is that customer-related or other work is building up through the first part of the day and being squeezed into the afternoons, often at the expense of service level. Monday (likely the busiest day of the week) takes a beating. Service level also drops Thursday afternoon, possibly the result of meetings, training or some other activity that occupies part of the team. Based on these observations, you could investigate the following: ▪ Can breaks and lunch be adjusted to provide better coverage during the mornings and afternoons? For example, can you move lunch to a later time for some agents? Granted, you have to be reasonable—few will want to take a break at 9 a.m. or eat lunch at 3 p.m. But even slight adjustments can yield significant results. ▪ Is service level and response time work being forecasted and managed as well as possible? Do supervisors and agents know when to move from handling customer workload into other types of work? Do they have real-time information? Can some of the work that is not time- sensitive be shifted into the evening, when service level is higher? ▪ Are there any scheduling strategies available that would provide better coverage on Monday? For instance, are there any activities currently handled on Monday that can be moved to another day? Is there any way to provide better coverage Thursday afternoon? Is Thursday the best time for the event that is affecting service level?"

The next figure reveals an erratic service level that is usually below the organization’s objective of 80 percent answered in 20 seconds.

Secrets to Better Scheduling Results Scheduling is a process that can be learned and continuously improved. You get better at it with practice! We’ve found that organizations getting the best results take steps beyond the mechanics of calculating required staff and putting schedules together. Here are five of their practices. 1. CLARIFY YOUR ORGANIZATION’S VALUES. This involves a dialogue and set of decisions with the organization’s senior-level management around key questions: What is the contact center’s mission? How committed are you to providing good service even when the forecasts may be uncertain? What are your priorities—which activities get done first? What alternatives exist to maintain consistent service levels, from scheduling options to backup from other departments or outside help? Be ready for these discussions. They are opportunities to clarify direction and make a case for the resources and support that the contact center requires. 2. MODEL DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. Modeling, or periodically creating test schedules with different sets of variables, can be a real eye-opener, leading to different possibilities and solutions. What’s the impact of changing contact-routing alternatives? Agent group structure? Schedule horizon? Training and meeting schedules? Shifts? While modeling takes time—you’re basically having a person or team produce example schedules under different parameters—you’ll get this investment back in multiples in the form of better decisions that come from an understanding of tradeoffs and points of leverage. Scheduling software can be a big help in this effort, particularly in larger or more complex centers. 3. ENSURE THAT ALL ACTIVITIES ARE INCLUDED. Too often, contact centers have extra work outside of the schedule that is unaccounted for but that exacts a heavy price on morale and quality when it’s ignored for too long (e.g., unfinished projects, administrative work, reading updates, coaching sessions, and case work). Take an inventory of activities that is as comprehensive and specific as possible. 4. RESOLVE THE “POWER STRUGGLES.” If “power struggle” sounds a bit dramatic, you ought to see some of the challenges those in forecasting and scheduling roles have encountered: requests from other areas preempting schedules, unplanned marketing campaigns, unannounced schedule exceptions among agent teams, and unclear lines of authority between supervisors and workforce planners. These challenges are not insurmountable—unless they go unaddressed. Educating supervisors and agents on the basics of forecasting and scheduling is an important part of the solution! 5. ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS IS FLEXIBLE AND INCLUSIVE. Effective scheduling will always involve a certain amount of trial and error.

And provide agents with schedule preferences and as much flexibility as possible. Scheduling is a bigger deal than it may initially appear to be. As workforce management expert Tiffany LaReau puts it, “The schedule is the fulcrum in the work–life balance scale, and the scheduling process deserves a maximum amount of care and consideration.” Yes, scheduling enables you to match resources with workload. It is also a creative process that can support your employees’ work-life balance and earn you higher levels of engagement— and it is a very practical opportunity to build and reinforce a customer-focused culture. ✽✽✽ Points to Remember ‣ Scheduling is both a forecast and a game plan. It requires accurate planning and must be revisited as often as needed. ‣ An important prerequisite to effective scheduling is to get your arms around all of the activities that occupy agents’ time, and to build realistic schedules. ‣ Many scheduling alternatives exist, even in relatively restrictive environments. You should regularly assess which alternatives are feasible in your contact center and how you can use them. ‣ Creating service level graphs by increment will reveal how well schedules are matching agents to the workload and will expose recurring problem areas."

    "paragraph": "A s surely as the laws of physics define the realities of air travel, fundamental principles govern contact centers. Misunderstanding or ignoring these principles leads to inconsistent service, demoralized employees, excessive costs, and poor customer experiences. Six “immutable laws” are at work in any center that handles inbound contacts. They are immutable because they always have been and always will be true. All are driven or at least influenced by random contact arrival (see Chapter 3). Let’s take a look at each. Along the way, I’ll offer some tips on bringing your team up to speed and ensuring that these immutable laws are working for (not against) your efforts. 1. When Service Level Goes Up, Occupancy Goes Down As discussed in Chapter 4, service level is expressed as “X percent of contacts answered in Y seconds.” Occupancy is the percentage of time during an interval that agents who are signed in and handling the workload are actually handling contacts. The inverse of occupancy is the time that agents are waiting to handle contacts. As the following table illustrates, a service level of 80 percent of contacts answered in 20 seconds (82/20 in this scenario) equates to an occupancy of 86 percent for that workload. If service level drops to 24 percent answered in 20 seconds, occupancy goes up to 97 percent."
  },
  {
    "page": 158,
    "paragraph": "The relationship between occupancy and service level is often misunderstood. The incorrect logic goes something like, “If agents really dig in, service level will go up and so will their occupancy.” In reality, if occupancy is high, it is because agents are working on one contact after another, with little or no wait in between. Contacts are stacked up in queue and service level is low. In the worst scenario, occupancy is 100 percent because all customers spend at least some time in queue and agents have no breathing room between contacts. When service level goes up, occupancy goes down (see figure, Contacts Per Agents Versus Service Level). Therefore, the average contacts handled per agent will also go down. Setting standards on number of contacts handled is not recommended, because agents can’t directly control occupancy. Doing so would also conflict with an important objective: ensure that enough agents are available to handle contacts so that your service level objectives are achieved. (We will discuss individual performance standards in Chapter 14.)"
  },
  {
    "page": 159,
    "paragraph": "Occupancy is driven by random contact arrival and is heavily influenced by service level and group size (see the third immutable law). Managers don’t exactly love this principle—no one wants “unproductive” time baked into the process. However, the time that agents spend waiting for contacts is sliced into 12 seconds here, two seconds there, and so on, and is a factor of how contacts are arriving. In many centers, agents handle other types of work when the inbound workload slows down. Blended environments (where agents handle different types of work based on workload requirements) make sense—no one has a perfect forecast, so schedules don’t always match staff to the call load. (As a rule, successful blended environments don’t switch agents from one type of work to another minute-by-minute; that’s simply too hard for any person to juggle and quite honestly inefficient. These blended environments do, however, make the switch for larger blocks of time: a few hours of this and a few hours of that.) But understand what is really happening. When other work is getting done, either: a) you have more agents scheduled than necessary to handle the workload at your service level goal; or b) service level is being sacrificed. Don’t try to force occupancy higher through non-contact work than what base staff calculations predict it should be. When Is Occupancy Too High? As any agent knows, periods of high occupancy are stressful. Studies suggest that agents"

    "paragraph": "begin to burn out around 90 percent occupancy if the condition lasts for an extended time, such as several half hours in a row (some studies set the threshold as low as 88 percent, others as high as 92 percent). Taking breaks is a natural reaction to high occupancy, but it compounds the problem. Consider this scenario. Jen, Ben, and Mary are three of 32 agents plugged in and taking calls. Staffing calculations (see table above) predict the average occupancy for the half hour for 32 agents will be 91 percent and service level will be just above 60 percent answered in 20 seconds. This is what these three agents may be thinking: Jen: Whew! It’s contact after contact this morning. I need a breather. I don’t have a scheduled break for 45 minutes, so I’m just going to grab some water for a couple of minutes. OOPS. Now there are only 31 agents handling the work. If traffic keeps arriving at the same clip, service level will drop and occupancy will go up. Ben: Things are busy today, one contact after another. This customer sure is friendly. I wonder if she’s getting that storm I’ve been hearing about… So Ben takes longer on the contact, essentially taking a breather during handling time. Service level drops another notch, and occupancy increases. Mary really begins to feel the load... Mary: This contact doesn’t really require wrap-up, but… This is the start of a downward spiral. If contacts are chronically backed up, service level will consistently be low and occupancy will be high. The real fix, of course, goes to the fundamentals of managing a contact center—a good forecast, accurate staffing calculations, and schedules that match people to the workload. It’s also important that each individual understands their impact (see The Power of One). Occupancy and Adherence to Schedule Notice an important distinction that this law reveals. When adherence to schedule improves, occupancy goes down. Why? Because when agents are available to handle more contacts, service level will go up. And when service level goes up, occupancy goes down. This means that if your agents adhere to their schedules, they don’t have to work as hard. This is an important concept for everyone to understand. When adherence to schedule improves (goes up), occupancy goes down. The terms adherence to schedule and occupancy are often incorrectly used interchangeably. They not only mean different things, they move in opposite directions. And as we will discuss at in Chapter 14, while adherence to schedule is within the control of individuals, occupancy is determined by factors outside of an individual’s control. 2. The Law of Diminishing Returns"

    "page": 161,
    "paragraph": "Economists identified the law of diminishing returns as it applies to manufacturing many years ago, but it also can have significant impact on other environments, including contact centers. It can be defined this way: when successive individual agents are assigned to a given workload, the incremental improvements in service level that can be attributed to each additional agent will eventually decline."

    "page": 161,
    "paragraph": "The Law of Diminishing Returns figure is based on Erlang C data from the staffing table at the beginning of this chapter. It shows that 30 agents at the given call load will provide a service level of 24 percent in 20 seconds. Keep in mind, these numbers will not be exact—at that low of a service level, many of the contacts will abandon (not get answered at all). But the exact results aside, service level will be poor. With 31 agents, things improve dramatically, as service level jumps to 45 percent. Adding one more person yields another big improvement. In fact, adding only four or five people takes service level from the depths to something respectable. That means an associated drop in average speed of answer (ASA) and trunk load. The same principle is true for larger groups, as the next table shows. Each person has a significant positive impact on the queue when service level is low, even in groups that are much larger."

    "paragraph": "Contact center managers who struggle with a low service level are fond of this immutable law because it often doesn’t take many people to improve things significantly. Those managers who want to be the “best of the best” in terms of service level find that the relationship between varying levels of resources and service level must be clearly outlined in the budgeting process. Viewed from a different angle, if you have the right number of people handling contacts to begin with, but just a few of them unplug or go unavailable at an inopportune moment, contacts begin to back up. Think of what a stalled car blocking just one lane can quickly do to a busy expressway. The Power of One The power of one is among the most important principles to introduce to new hires and reinforce with experienced agents. While we know the impact each agent has on individual customers and the subsequent publicity (good or bad) that can come from those experiences, the power of one refers more specifically to queues and wait times. The central theme that shapes contact center operations is that they are dynamic; workloads arrive randomly in any center that handles customer-initiated contacts. This, coupled with the reality of how queues behave, means that agents who are helping manage the workload affect service level—in a good way—far more than they may realize."

Occupancy goes down, from 97 percent to 94 percent (that might not sound like a big drop, but it feels a lot better!). Yes, one person makes that much of a difference for customers and the rest of the team! Adding one more person yields another big improvement. As you can see, if you let your eyes follow the rows down the table, there’s a point at which adding agents doesn’t help much, because service is already good. You get into the law of diminishing returns. Next, look at what happens to customers at different staffing levels (see figure, Customer Delay). If you have 34 agents handling contacts, 65 customers are waiting five seconds or longer. Seven customers reach agents in the next five seconds, so 58 are still waiting ten seconds or longer.

Just consider the ripple effect of customer reviews or publicity (good or bad) that can come from any interaction. An American Express study found that consumers tell 21 others on average about a poor service experience. We’ve all seen videos of bad experiences that went viral. And positive word of mouth builds powerful brands. When you give a good customer service experience, you’re creating a powerful marketing force for your company.

My encouragement is to keep it front and center with your team!"

    "paragraph": "Here are some of the steps organizations are taking to reinforce the power of one. Think through how you could approach them with your team. ▪ Educate each person on how much impact he or she has on the queue—and incorporate these or similar scenarios into training. ▪ Develop reasonable expectations for adherence to schedules, and explain the reasoning behind those expectations. ▪ Educate everyone on the core steps involved in forecasting and resource planning, so that they know how schedules are produced and where they come from. ▪ Provide real-time queue information to agents on readerboards, desktops or phones. (We’ll discuss how to use this information in Chapter 11.) ▪ Develop appropriate priorities for the full range of tasks that your team handles and guidelines for how to respond to evolving conditions. ✽✽✽ UNDERSTANDING HOW CONTACT CENTERS BEHAVE The central reality that shapes contact center operations is that they are dynamic in the truest sense. Because of the randomly arriving nature of customer contacts, each person has a big impact on the organization’s responsiveness. That, in turn, is an important enabler to delivering great customer experiences, boosting loyalty and contributing to successful business results. A notable trend among the most effective contact centers is to educate their entire teams (agents, supervisors, managers and analysts, as well as colleagues from across their organizations) on contact center dynamics, the power of one, and the value the organization delivers when strong cross-functional support is in place. American Express, USAA, and FedEx are just a few examples of highly rated companies that have made this an ongoing priority. Providing an understanding of how contact centers behave is a gift to those who work in or support them. It just makes good sense. ✽✽✽ 3. Larger Groups Are More Efficient Average group productivity (contacts that a group handles) is not a constant factor. Instead, it’s constantly fluctuating as the workload ebbs and flows. Even when you maintain a consistent service level through good planning and on-target scheduling; you’ll find that average productivity is relatively lower at lower volumes and relatively higher at higher workloads. Because the number of contacts is changing throughout the day, so is average group productivity. Why? Mathematically, larger groups of agents are more efficient than smaller groups, at the same service level. Therefore, larger groups assigned to heavy mid-morning traffic will be more"

Attempting to compare groups or sites in a multi-site environment may also be misleading (the exception would be a network that finds the longest- waiting agent, a true virtual contact center). Despite mathematical efficiencies, there is a point where groups become so large that occupancy becomes too high for agents. Some managers believe that the number of agents in a single group should be limited to 125 to 150 people. However, plenty of centers have much larger agent groups (the U.S. Social Security Administration, Centrelink Australia, China Mobile and others have hundreds or even thousands of agents in a single agent group)."

    "page": 167,
    "paragraph": "Rather than establishing a strict limit to group size, a better approach is to watch occupancy and take appropriate measures when it climbs above 90 percent. For example, in the scenario presented under law #2, scheduling so that 129 agents or more are handling the work is recommended, even though the required service level may be exceeded. Customers sure won’t mind, and your staff will be able to function efficiently throughout their shift. 4. The Powerful Pooling Principle The powerful pooling principle is a mathematical fact that goes like this: any movement in the direction of consolidation of resources will result in improved traffic-carrying efficiency. Conversely, any movement away from consolidation of resources will result in reduced traffic- carrying efficiency. Put more simply, if you take several small, specialized agent groups, and effectively cross-train them and put them into a single group, you’ll have a more efficient environment. ✽✽✽ The Powerful Pooling Principle ▪ Handle more contacts, at the same service level, with the same number of agents"

Fifteen agents are required to provide a service level of 80/20. But only 124 agents, not 150, are necessary to handle a load 10 times as large. The pooling principle should be a consideration from the highest levels of strategic planning (How many centers should you have? How should agent groups be designed?), down to more tactical decisions related to real-time adjustments or how to best invest training time and resources. In one sense, pooling resources is at the heart of what ACDs and networks do. A clear trend in recent years, though, is the recognition that customers often have different needs and expectations, and that different agents with a mix of aptitudes and skills are required. Powerful capabilities, such as skills-based routing, give us the means to route and handle contacts based on myriad criteria (see Chapter 7)."

    "paragraph": "Can you have specialization without forgoing the benefits of the powerful pooling principle? It depends. Skills-based routing can boost efficiency by getting contacts to the agents best suited to handle them. But when not managed well, or when overused, the number of contingencies can multiply beyond your management team’s ability to understand and manage them. The interplay can become stupefying. And the whole notion of agent groups and pooling begins to erode. When skills and routing priorities become too complex, related dangers begin to emerge. Doug Casterton, Head of Global Workforce Planning and Scheduling for Trip Advisor in Oxford, U.K., warns of the “eversinking queue.” When skill priorities have been set a different level, “it’s possible for the higher priority contacts to jump the queue, and if you have not correctly staffed, the lower priority contacts may never actually reach an agent.” As real and pervasive as the pooling principle is, it is not an all-or-nothing proposition. There is a continuum between pooling and specialization—think of a variable thermostat rather than an on/off switch. Your objective should be to get as close to the pooled end of the spectrum as"

    "paragraph": "circumstances allow. Examples of supporting steps would include: ▪ Improve training and coaching, to enable agents to handle more contact types. ▪ Hire multilingual agents to better cover all supported languages. ▪ Integrate new channels—such as social media or chat—into existing agent groups as much as feasible. ▪ Improve knowledge management systems so that agents have the information needed to handle a broad a range of contacts. ▪ Work on reducing turnover and improving agent tenure (their experience levels). You get the idea. These and other steps you can take to effectively broaden the work types agents handle will, by definition, boost efficiencies. 5. Add Staff and ASA Goes Down Anyone who has ever waited in line for anything knows that if there were a few more tollbooths, open check-out aisles, or people behind the counter, the line wouldn’t be so long! And when someone behind the counter gets reassigned to another task or goes on break, the wait increases (this happens anytime I enter a physical line—perhaps it’s a cosmic joke on those of us who study queues). The same principle is at work in contact centers. When more agents are plugged in and handling contacts, assuming they are trained to do so proficiently, the queue will be shorter. Fewer agents means a longer queue. This principle leads to the next immutable law. 6. Add Staff and Trunk Load Goes Down When more agents are assigned to a given workload, trunk load (the load on the network that handles voice and data) goes down. The converse is also true: when fewer agents are available to handle a given workload, trunk load goes up because the delay increases (see discussion on trunks, Chapter 7). Each customer connected to your system is part of the workload, whether they are talking to an agent or waiting in queue. If you have toll-free service (or any other service that charges a usage fee), you are paying for this time. Telecommunications costs are inextricably wrapped in staffing issues. If service level is continually low, the costs of network services will escalate. The following example illustrates the tradeoffs between staffing levels and service level, average speed of answer, occupancy, and trunk load. Recall from Chapter 7 that trunk load represents how much time (in hours) customers are queued for and/or talking to agents in a particular group over the equivalent of an hour. Staff is calculated for a half hour’s traffic, but the trunk load is converted to an hour’s traffic (“erlangs”) simply because telecom managers universally use hour increments for engineering and management purposes."

    "paragraph": "Understanding Trunk Load Want to see where these numbers come from? (Not to worry; it doesn’t take long, and you’ll get the idea). Using the scenario in the table, assume that you have 46 agents handling contacts and, therefore, will be able to achieve a service level of 80/20. Here’s how the calculations produced an estimated 37.6 hours on the trunks: ▪ First, you can see that customers will be queued for agents an average of 13 seconds (ASA) and will be connected to agents an average of 180 seconds (average talk time), for a total of 193 seconds. The 180 seconds represents the forecast for what average talk time will likely be; the 13 seconds ASA comes from the Erlang C calculation. ▪ Because the table provides volume for a half hour, double 350 contacts to assume 700 contacts in an hour. ▪ Because the 700 calls spend an average 193 seconds queuing for and connected to agents, the trunk load in seconds is 135,100 seconds (700 contacts × 193 seconds). ▪ Finally, because trunk load is presented in erlangs (hours of traffic over the course of an hour), divide 135,100 by 3,600 (the number of seconds in an hour) and you come up with 37.6 hours. To use the correct telecom lingo, you’ll have the equivalent of 37.6 erlangs of traffic on the trunks for this agent group during this time period. (Note: this example does not include the time customers may spend in the IVR before arriving at the agent group, which would need to be"

    "paragraph": "added.) The big variable is the time customers spend in queue before they get connected. It goes up (gets worse) with fewer agents, and goes down (gets better) with more agents. Glance through the table, and you’ll see that if 50 agents are handling calls, ASA will be a projected 3 seconds. If 42 agents are handling calls, ASA will be a projected 144 seconds. In short, the number of agents handling work determines the average delay, which is a key variable in trunk load and, accordingly, in what you pay for toll-free services. The Impact of Staff on Toll-Free Costs As you decide on service levels and how to allocate budgets, you should think about network costs, too. All other things being equal, if your service level is low, adding an agent will often bring total costs down because network costs will drop dramatically. The staff versus toll-free costs tradeoff used to be much more dramatic. In many parts of the world, toll-free costs are just pennies (or less) a minute. Toll-free service used to be much more expensive to organizations (15 cents per minute or higher). So, improving service level meant huge drops in network costs, often producing savings that far surpassed the cost of adding staff. With today’s far lower network costs, the tradeoff is less significant. However, you still have expense for carrying the traffic, and there are also costs related to ports, IVR capacity, maintenance, taxes, and other budgetary line items. Delay takes resources and it is not free. Assessing the impact on network costs underscores the importance of considering both agent and network costs together. Improving service level will save money on network services; these savings should be factored into predictions of overall costs. The Cost of Delay The direct expense of putting customers in queue is called the “cost of delay.” It is expressed in terms of how much you pay for toll-free service each day (or month, hour, or half hour) just for customers to wait in queue until they reach an agent. You may want to plot the cost of delay. It’s simple. First, take the total delay for the day, as reported by your ACD, and convert that into minutes or hours. Next, multiply the minutes or hours of delay by the average per-minute or per-hour cost of your toll-free service. Then add that figure to a graph that illustrates these costs (see example)."

Just as important as the information itself is establishing good lines of communication, and fostering an understanding of how contact centers operate and how they support the organization’s overall mission.

A first step to getting necessary support is ensuring that senior-level managers understand the unique contact center environment—what they do and how they operate. Here’s a list of 10 “must knows” that I believe are a good starting point for understanding the nature of contact centers. I encourage you to take stock of these and look for ways to boost your senior management’s understanding. 1. CONTACT CENTERS ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO THE ORGANIZATION’S SUCCESS. They are strategic assets, not clerical/administrative/backroom operations. They are hubs of communication—vital to understanding and serving diverse customers, capturing marketplace intelligence, and harnessing the voice of the customer to improve products and services. 2. CONTACTS “BUNCH UP.” In any center that handles at least some inbound work, the workflow dynamics are unique (see Chapter 3). Customers decide when and how they will contact the organization, and the resulting work will not arrive in a nice, even flow. Staffing and productivity issues must be considered in that context (see Chapters 7 and 14). 3. THERE’S GENERALLY NO INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR ACCESSIBILITY. No single service level or response time objective makes sense for every contact center. Different"

    "page": 176,
    "paragraph": "organizations will have different costs, customers and brand objectives. However, there are objectives that will make sense for your organization—that fit your customers’ needs and your organization’s brand (Chapter 4). 4. THERE’S A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN RESOURCES AND RESULTS. You may need 36 people handling contacts to achieve a service level of 90 percent answer in 20 seconds, given your customer workload. It’s not going to work if you have only 25 people and are told to hit a 90/20 service level. And scrimping on staffing is expensive, leading to high agent occupancy, burnout and turnover, unhappy customers, poor word of mouth, and other direct and indirect costs (Chapters 7, 9 and 13). 5. WHEN SERVICE LEVEL IMPROVES, “PRODUCTIVITY” DECLINES. Productivity is often measured as contacts handled or occupancy. (This is a perspective I hope to help change; see Chapter 14.) As discussed in Chapter 9, when service level goes up, occupancy goes down, as does the average number of contacts handled per agent. Translation: in any center that is achieving a good service level, agents will be waiting (idle) some of the time, given the nature of random contact arrival (Chapter 9). 6. YOU WILL NEED TO SCHEDULE MORE STAFF THAN BASE STAFF REQUIRED. Schedules should realistically reflect the many things that can keep agents from handling contacts, such as training, breaks, holidays, collateral or ancillary work and other diversions (see Chapter 8). In many organizations, these factors are becoming more prevalent, as the increasingly complex environment requires more time for training, research, and other activities. 7. SUMMARY REPORTS DON’T GIVE AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF WHAT’S REALLY HAPPENING. Reports that show averages of activity may suggest that performance is just fine, yet they may be concealing serious problem areas. Those producing and interpreting data must know what they’re really looking at (see discussions in this chapter and Chapters 4 and 12). 8. QUALITY AND SERVICE LEVEL WORK TOGETHER. Though they are sometimes presented as tradeoffs, service level is inextricably tied to getting contacts into the center and handled in a quality fashion. And better quality is the key to a better service level, by upping first-contact resolution, reducing repeat contacts, and picking up intelligence (“knowledge”) that helps improve processes, products, and services across the organization (Chapters 12, 13). 9. CONTACT CENTERS ARE BECOMING MORE COMPLEX. Traditional transaction-oriented centers have evolved into more dynamic and holistic operations that contribute to and require the support of departments across the organization. Social media, omnichannel, multi-generational customers, competition, AI-driven self-serve technologies that handle more routine activities, and other trends are raising the bar (see Chapters 2 and 15). 10. TO FULFILL THEIR POTENTIAL, CONTACT CENTERS NEED SUPPORT FROM THE TOP. They need commitment and involvement from senior management to ensu"

    "paragraph": "I am convinced that the only way to really understand the unique customer contact environment is to spend some time in it. These are issues you’ll need to continually reinforce— but they tend to come to life when experienced firsthand. Senior-level executives who have made the effort to understand contact center issues and processes invariably come away with better insight into evolving customer requirements and interdependencies across the larger organization. ✽✽✽ HANDS-ON LEADERSHIP One of the keys to high levels of employee engagement in contact centers—and the strong performance that follows—is hands-on involvement from the top. For example: ▪ Among other endeavors, Dan Gilbert is the founder and chairman of Quicken Loans, the giant Detroit-based mortgage lender. Gilbert speaks often of Quicken’s core values, saying that they “drive every decision, every action, behavior, and prioritization.” As he grew the company, Gilbert made a practice of spending an entire day with groups of new customer service employees (a responsibility now passed to others in top management). As of this writing, J.D. Power’s Customer Satisfaction Study has listed Quicken as the highest-ranked mortgage servicer for five consecutive years. ▪ When Mary Barra took over as CEO and chairman of General Motors (GM), she inherited an extreme challenge. An ignition switch fault had led to more than 100 deaths and the recall of more than 2.6 million vehicles. She took accountability, met with affected families, set up a compensation fund, and communicated directly and honestly with employees. “Employees saw Barra in call centers taking calls and listening in, and speaking with employees,” recounts Jeanne Bliss in her insightful book, Would You Do That to Your Mother. “Barra’s courage gave her entire company the values they are to uphold, when unity and solidarity in her organization mattered the most.” (See Chapter 15, GM Leverages AI in Social Customer Care.) ✽✽✽ Principles of Effective Budgeting Ensuring that you’re getting necessary resources is an important part of enabling the contact center’s strategic potential. That, of course, requires an effective budget—and a clear understanding of what the returns on those investments should be. A budget is simply a summary of proposed or agreed-upon expenditures (costs) for a given period of time, for specified purposes. Sounds easy enough. But the process of putting together a budget is often seen as tedious, time-consuming and, some say, a distraction from “more important management responsibilities.” However, don’t forget the outcome of this much- maligned process: the funding the contact center needs to accomplish its mission and potential. Here are the essential principles I’ve uncovered in analyzing and working with contact centers that consistently get the right amount of funding, at the right times, for the right things: VIEW THE BUDGET AS MUCH MORE THAN A DOCUMENT.

I’ve seen managers spend many hours—make that many days—putting the details together, only to have their priorities swept away or diluted in a matter of minutes in the CFO’s office. I’ve also seen powerful (and positive) budgetary agreements happen over coffee, literally on the back of a napkin. Remember, it’s the effectiveness of your case, not the detail of your analysis, that matters most. When you see the budget as an ongoing dialogue, and not just a document, you spend more of your time and talent on opening channels of communication, educating decision makers and highlighting key priorities and tradeoffs. In short, you focus on ensuring that the effort leads to the right results. ANSWER THE BIG QUESTIONS. Anticipate and be ready for the big questions. Why are we spending this money? Why does the contact center exist? Why are we spending more (or less) than last year? These questions form the backdrop of the budgetary process. The answers are sometimes addressed in the communication that takes place during the process, and also may be summarized in budgetary documents. Regardless, those who are involved in preparing and approving the budget need a shared understanding of the value the center contributes to the organization. REMEMBER TO FOCUS ON RESULTS. Handling 1.7 million calls, achieving 90 percent first-call resolution, or hitting service level targets are not the results decision makers are looking for. They are only means to an end. As your center’s objectives and focus mature from handling interactions efficiently to delivering great customer experiences, you will have a greater impact on business results—including revenues, profitability, market share and word of mouth (see figure). Illustrating this connection focuses budgetary discussion on the things that matter most (see Chapters 12 and 13)."

These activities should take much of the work out of the budget process, because the budget should ultimately be based on the already-established forecasting and planning steps. Forecasting, staffing, scheduling, and cost analysis are ongoing responsibilities. These activities should take much of the work out of the budget process, because the budget should ultimately be based on the already-established forecasting and planning steps. There’s an important principle at work here. Objectives should drive the budget, not the other way around. If your budget is based solely on precedent (last year’s numbers), arbitrary decisions, or anything other than the objectives identified in your customer access strategy and workload predictions, you are at a disadvantage from the start. If that’s the case, you’ve got a great opportunity to reshape assumptions (see figure, Key Objectives Drive the Budget). IDENTIFY KEY TRADEOFFS. What happens if the forecast is high? Low? What happens if you provide better levels of service? Worse levels of service? How much would you save/spend if …? Once the budget for the expected workload and recommended resources is established, it is fairly straightforward to rerun scenarios for both different workload assumptions and alternative service levels (step 9 of the planning process).

Legal departments are increasingly helping the center make the case for investments that will improve tracking and consistency in handling customer contacts. And product development budget may be directed to the contact center for improved analysis on customer suggestions and input. These possibilities become evident to the degree that relationships exist and collaboration is in place among functional areas. HIGHLIGHT INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

PRESENT THE BUDGET FORMALLY. This recommendation may seem to be a contradiction, given the emphasis on collaboration and communication. But a formal presentation can be an important part of the process. To start, it can be the catalyst for getting all decision makers together at one time. (How many times did you answer the same questions for different people last year?) All in attendance will hear the questions and comments of the others, saving time and raising the general level of understanding more quickly. KEEP THE PRESENTATION SHORT AND UNCLUTTERED. Use graphs and illustrations where possible. Provide backup material as necessary, such as actual system reports (but not as a part of the main presentation).

She contacted us because she was concerned that …” Examples bring realities to life. And service tradeoffs become much more relevant when the loyalty and positive word-of-mouth from Sarah and 1,199,999 other customers are at stake. ANTICIPATE AND PREPARE FOR THE “USUAL QUESTIONS.” They have come up a jillion (give or take) times before, and they will come up a jillion times in the future: ▪ What did we spend on the center in total last year? ▪ Did it accomplish what we intended it to? ▪ What was our ROI on these investments? ▪ What’s the contact per customer ratio? Sales per customer? ▪ Is growth in some channels (e.g., chat, social media, self-service) changing the workload for agents? (Reducing? Increasing? Altering?) ▪ What’s our cost per contact? Is it going down or up? ▪ What are you doing to reduce unnecessary contacts? ▪ Can we use the resources we have now to handle the expected workload? There are others, and you probably know what they are in your situation. Be ready. These questions are your opportunity to shine.

An important principle in managing growth is to do an analysis of its likely impact in advance. The objective is to avoid surprises as you go into the budget process. Accurate growth projections often take the form of a document that illustrates projected costs and timeframes, such as 5 percent growth in workload, 10 percent growth, 20 percent growth, and so on (up to at least double the current size if you’re growing quickly). Your analysis should consider each major contact center component and answer important questions such as: When will you need additional ACD and IVR capacity? More space? Additional supervisors or analysts? What is the ideal lead time for each increment of growth? How long does it take to recruit, hire and train agents? Contraction is also a planning challenge. Even as many grapple with growth, long- established contact centers in some industries have closed or reduced in size. For example, hotels and airlines have successfully encouraged a large portion of customers to use self-service systems for inquiries, bookings, check-in, and upgrades. In these cases, plans and budgets must anticipate how contact centers can be scaled down as workload drops. React too slowly, and expensive and unnecessary resources drive up costs. Cut too quickly, and service will be poor. Because the document is a projection, it won’t precisely predict required resources. But it will illustrate required lead times and key decision points necessary to align resources with workload. Your goal is to help your organization avoid costly surprises. Long-Term Staffing Requirements For most contact centers, staffing makes up between 65 and 75 percent of the budget. These figures can vary greatly depending on salaries, technology investments, cost differences by region, and other factors. But it’s safe to conclude that this one slice of the budgetary pie usually exceeds all other costs combined. Getting it right is a make-or-break factor in the center’s efficiency and effectiveness. Let’s take a look at the basics of longer-term staff planning. As discussed in Chapter 8, effective scheduling depends on both longer-term budgets and short-term execution. You’ll need a big enough bucket of resources to work with—in other words, the right number of staff on payroll (or through contracts) to put together schedules that match workload requirements. You’ll also need to manage schedule adherence, a subject we’ll discuss in Chapter 14. A long-term staffing plan (sometimes called budgetary staffing plan) generally represents staffing requirements at a monthly level for the next 12 months. The goal is to accurately predict the paid hours required to handle the workload at your target service level and response time objectives.

These variables are illustrated in the following table. Note that lunch is missing from the list. Because (in our illustration) it is not paid time, it is not included in this model. Also, the factor used for breaks is adjusted for “presence” (you shouldn’t count breaks for agents not at work). Consequently, if agents are not at work 16.52 percent of the time (meaning they are at work 83.48 percent of the time), the factor would be 30 minutes (time on breaks) divided by 480 minutes (minutes in a workday), multiplied by 83.48 percent.

Don’t let the term trip you up—schedule adherence, which is in the example below, isn’t random in a mathematical sense like random contact arrival, as you can cause a positive impact on schedule adherence (see Chapter 14). But while you can accurately predict the total amount of time that will go to these factors, they are random because you cannot predict the minute-to-minute impact.

Since this number often does not match the current staffing in the center, I recommend going one step further and incorporating a staff planning component that illustrates gaps between the required and the current headcount. The staff planning section includes current staff, turnover and new-hire information. It also factors in part-time employees and shows how close your current staff comes to your required staff. Hiring plans are often produced months in advance (perhaps by someone outside the contact center) around general business trends.

I’ve found that talking through the process line-by-line helps those who are involved understand and participate in the assumptions. As a result, they usually feel much more comfortable about how you reached your requirements. There may be spirited discussion along the way about specific issues. But with line-by-line agreement (and changes that may be merited), one plus one plus three should add up to five—not four or six. ✽✽✽ Points to Remember ‣ Senior management needs (and deserves) a basic knowledge of the contact center; the summary of 10 key principles covered here is good starting point. ‣ Anticipating the impact of growth (or reduction) of the center’s workload is critical, and it should be a part of the communication and budgeting process. ‣ The budgeting process should build credibility and clearly demonstrate important tradeoffs and decision points. ‣ An effective staffing budget is fully adjustable, clearly demonstrates the “whys” behind budget requirements, and enables all stakeholders to easily see the results of changes in any variable. ‣ In essence, making a case for the resources the contact center needs is communication. It happens best as part of an approach that ensures the right information is presented and understood by all who are part of the process."

    "paragraph": "O kay, the planning is done, the schedules are in place and the contacts are pouring in—far more, or perhaps far fewer, than expected. Uh oh, now what? Even with good forecasts and accurate schedules, the random arrival of customer contacts means that contact centers operate in a “demand and supply” mode. Demand must be followed by the supply of agents and supporting resources able to handle the workload. If you think about it, any given moment, there are almost always either a) more contacts to be handled than resources available, or b) more resources than contacts. Those rare times that they are in perfect balance (with no waiting agents and no waiting customers) last a fleeting moment or two, before the balance tips in one direction or the other. Up and down, ebb and flow. Contact centers are dynamic, ever-changing environments. And then—adding to challenge—there are those times that planning goes off the rails. The forecast misses the mark. Customers behave differently than expected (e.g., that new app was supposed to reduce workload, not increase it!). Marketing sends a social media blast without telling you. The flu is taking a toll on your team. Oh, and IT is working on a desktop upgrade and you are finding that moving … from … screen … to … screen … is … sluggish. Just a little more time, every contact, every agent, all day long. So, even the most accurate contact center planning must be augmented by effective real-time management: monitoring events as they happen and making adjustments as necessary. Real-time management should complement planning. After the planning is done, it’s the moment-by- moment decisions and actions that enable you to maintain an appropriate service level and response time.

    "paragraph": "Empowering Your Team Real-time management is often viewed as a matter of responding to workload quantities. What’s often missed in these discussions is how to respond to the nature of the workload. If it’s heavy, there usually are underlying issues driving it. You can throw all the resources at it that you want, but if your organization isn’t prepared to handle the content of the work, it’s going to be a struggle—for customers and employees. This is an area where empowerment is so important (we’ll discuss empowerment further in Chapters 14 and 16). Many organizations want to do the right thing for customers, but too often put a multi-layered, time-eroding approval process in place to get there. By then, the customer is gone, or the loyalty that could arise from their experience has dwindled. That’s not effective empowerment; in fact, it’s not empowerment at all. Your agents must be able to take action as circumstances unfold. You can’t expect them to be effective unless they have the authority and means to make decisions. For years, The Ritz-Carlton has given staff $2,000 of discretion, per employee and per guest, to resolve problems as the employee feels is appropriate. As a senior manager explains, “Sometimes the most delightful ‘wow’ moments happen in the blink of an eye. If employees are not empowered and need to cross layers of approval, these moments could be lost forever.” (I have seen this in action—while staying at a Ritz-Carlton, I once had a lunch immediately comped when it was delivered later than promised.) Many executives, understandably, are initially concerned with empowering employees to the extent that The Ritz-Carlton does. But empowerment is actually cost-effective. Employees appreciate the trust and want to make decisions that are right for customers and the organization. And because it’s happening on the spot, you are saving resources and aggravation by minimizing the need for managers to review and approve decisions. The key is to have clear standards and guidance on how to make good decisions. Here are the kinds of questions each employee should be equipped to answer: ▪ What’s the right thing to do? ▪ What would resolve the problem for this customer? ▪ What decision best aligns with our values and mission? ▪ If absolutely necessary, how and to whom do I escalate this issue? ▪ How should I best capture information and learnings about this issue so that we are equipped as an organization to make improvements going forward? Training and coaching should be focused on these key questions. Create scenarios and role plays that strengthen judgment and decision-making skills. You won’t be able to anticipate and train on every situation that comes along, but you can provide a foundation that leads to good decisions no matter the circumstance."

    "paragraph": "✽✽✽ HANDLING TOUGH CONTACTS How equipped are your agents for those situations when something is going wrong? When customers are clearly upset? Here are some time-tested tips: ▪ If your organization messed up, acknowledge it in a sincere way—and in plain language. (How often as a customer do you see or hear the scripted words, “We regret any inconvenience this may have caused”?) As writing coach and trainer Leslie O’Flahavan soundly advises, if you wouldn’t say something to a customer face-to-face, don’t use it. (I prefer something like, “Thanks for letting us know we let you down, and for giving us a chance to make it right.”) ▪ Some things shouldn’t play out in a public forum, even if that’s where they begin (e.g., through a social media post). Get the customer’s okay to move the discussion elsewhere. ▪ Take ownership and resolve the issue—if at all possible, fix it! What would it take to earn back the loyalty of this customer? If the customer is asking for the impossible, at least be prepared to give options. ▪ How you frame things matters. When speaking with a customer whose flight was hampered by bad weather, there’s a big difference between “I can’t get you on a flight until tomorrow” and “I can get you out first thing in the morning—would you like for me to secure one of those seats?” ▪ Document what happened and the circumstances that drove it. Problems can (will!) continue to occur until a root cause is identified and resolved. How your agents respond to tough situations, as much as anything else, shows the true character of your organization. ✽✽✽ Building a Cultural Foundation Along with empowerment, there are principles that, when better understood by your team, will help you build a strong cultural foundation. These include understanding the relationship between service level and quality, the impact of each person, consistency, and others. Service Level and Quality One very important principle is the complementary (hand-in-hand) relationship between service level and quality (covered in Chapters 4 and 13). Although service level and quality seem to be at odds in the short term, poor quality will force a negative impact on service level in the longer term—by contributing to repeat and escalated contacts, duplicate or parallel contacts, and other forms of waste and rework. So, the emphasis should be on handling each contact cleanly and correctly, regardless of how backed up the queue is. Your agents might believe they are getting mixed signals from management: “Hey, you train us to do a quality job, but then you put a lot of emphasis on achieving a service level and response time objectives. You put queue displays all over the place and get unhappy when service level and response times drop. What do you really want?”"

Look at the contacts in queue, make sure that you are plugged in (and in the right mode), and do what’s possible to arrange flexible activities around the workload. But remember that each contact must be handled with quality, regardless of what’s happening with service level. The Impact of Each Person Remember the law of diminishing returns and the power of one (covered in Chapter 9). The message, as it relates to real-time management, is clear: When the queue is backed up, each person makes a big difference! This issue sheds light on the importance of training agents on how a queue behaves (including how quickly it can spin out of control) and arming them with real-time information so they can adjust priorities as necessary. Real-time information can be delivered via: ▪ Queue information on desktop displays ▪ Wall- or ceiling-mounted readerboards ▪ Displays on phones ▪ Mobile apps ▪ Supervisor monitors ▪ Flip charts (which sounds so last century, but can help bring focus) Queue information must be complemented with appropriate training so that agents know what to look for and how to react. Remember that there are only two things directly within the control of agents: being in the right place at the right times, and doing the right things (schedule adherence and quality). A backed-up queue does not mean you should modify the process for handling contacts with quality. Real-time queue information must be interpreted in that context, a subject we’ll look at further in this chapter, and in Chapters 12 and 14."

    "paragraph": "It’s important to establish clear expectations around schedule adherence, a subject we’ll cover in Chapter 14. Too often, adherence is viewed only as an issue of “how much” (the total time the agent is plugged in) when it’s equally an issue of “when” (are they available at the right times?). A key responsibility of supervisors and team leaders is to remove schedule roadblocks so that agents can be in the right places at the right times. Auto Available and Auto Wrap-Up Most ACD systems can be programmed for either “auto available” or “auto wrap-up.” Auto available automatically puts agents into the available mode after they complete a contact. Auto wrap-up automatically puts them into the after-call work mode. It usually makes sense to program your system to put agents into the mode they will most often need to be in initially. This can save seconds (which add up over the course of a year’s contacts) and minimize the need for agents to manually put themselves into one mode or another. But also give them control over how much time they spend in wrap-up, as the needs of individual contacts dictate. Some managers program their ACD to put agents into the after-call work mode for a predetermined amount of time. This is a bad idea, as there is no way you can anticipate how much time after-call work will take for any individual contact. Averages don’t work here. If your objective is to give agents “breathers” by adding time to after-call work, you are by default adding more time to each contact, further backing up the queue (and defeating your purpose). Another alternative you have when programming your ACD is to use a feature generally referred to as “contact forcing” (or “call forcing”). This may strike you as an autocratic-sounding term, but it’s actually a valuable and agent-friendly capability. With this feature, contacts are automatically connected to agents who are available and ready (thereby eliminating the need for them to manually answer contacts). Agents are notified that a contact has arrived by a gentle “zip tone” (a beep). Studies indicate that contact forcing can cut four to six seconds from average handling time. And agents almost always like the feature once they get used to it. It removes what would be an extra step. Importantly, they remain in full control. If they aren’t ready for a contact, they simply stay out of the available mode. ✽✽✽ PERPETUATING tHE PROBLEM Real-time management, though essential, has a serious downside. Real-time tactics that increase supply or curb demand can also undermine the organization’s ability to create accurate resource plans. These approaches—overflowing contacts to secondary groups, postponing breaks and training, or reassigning agents to unplanned work—create skewed activity reports. They can defer (delay) essential work or training. And they often complicate future workload and schedule predictions.

    "paragraph": "implications on planning and management. ✽✽✽ Consistency Another important step in building a good foundation is to ensure that agents maintain a consistent approach to handling contacts, regardless of queue conditions. Each agent has an impact on the components of workload, and therefore on the data that will be used in forecasting and planning for future workloads. When the queue is building, it can be tempting to postpone work that should happen as part of wrap-up. This skews reports, causes planning problems, and can lead to more errors. The solution is to define which types of work should immediately follow contact handling and which types can be completed later. Then, train agents and supervisors accordingly. Accurate Resource Planning Real-time management can never make up for inadequate planning. The nine-step planning process covered in preceding chapters should be as accurate as possible. This includes: ▪ Establishing service level and response time objectives that everyone understands ▪ Accurately forecasting the workload associated with all types of contacts ▪ Calculating staffing requirements ▪ Planning for and managing activities not related to handling customer contacts ▪ Building schedules that match staff to the workload as closely as possible Monitoring Real-Time Developments The third major principle in effective real-time management is to monitor developments and identify trends as early as possible. The key is to react appropriately to evolving conditions. Random contact arrival means that, at times, it will look like you are falling behind even though you are staffed appropriately. But if you are experiencing a genuine trend, you need to move quickly. Time is of the essence."

    "paragraph": "Interpreting Queue Status Service level is “rolling” history. The ACD has to look back some amount of time or at some number of contacts to make the calculation. Consequently, even though service level is a primary focus in planning, it is not a sensitive real-time report. (In the strictest definition, it’s not a real- time report at all.) With many ACDs, you can define how far back the system looks to provide real-time service level status. You may need to experiment some. You’ll need enough of a sample that reports aren’t all over the place, but to be valuable, the sample also must be fairly recent. Also note that “screen refresh” does not correlate to the timeframe used for calculations. Your monitors may display updated information every few seconds, but that has nothing to do with how much data your ACD uses for the calculations that require rolling history. Service level will tell you what has already happened, given recent unique contact volume, random arrival, average handling time and staff availability patterns. But it’s important to realize that what is being reported is not necessarily an indication of what is about to happen. However, the number of contacts presently in queue is a real-time report, as is “longest current wait” and “current agent status.” Understanding the distinction between reports that are genuinely real-time and those that must incorporate some history explains apparent contradictions."

    "paragraph": "For example, service level may indicate 65 percent of contacts are answered in 20 seconds, even though there are no contacts in queue at the moment. Keep watching the monitor, though, and service level will begin to climb. Alternatively, service level may look high at the moment, even though an enormous volume of contacts recently entered the queue. Give it a few minutes and, unless circumstances change, service level will begin to drop like a rock. There will be a delay of at least several minutes before service level begins to reflect the impact of what is happening. So for service level to have meaning, it must be interpreted in light of the recent past, contacts in queue and current longest wait. If you focus on service level alone, you could badly misread the situation. Unless conditions change, the number of contacts in queue signals where service level is about to go. So—this piece of data should be a primary focus, along with longest current wait. That information should drive you to assess the mode agents are in—signed off, auxiliary, handling contacts, etc.—and make appropriate adjustments. In summary, focus on real-time reports in this order: 1. NUMBER OF CONTACTS IN QUEUE. This is the real-time report most sensitive to changes and trends. Look at this first. 2. LONGEST CURRENT WAIT (OLDEST CONTACT). This is a real-time report, but it behaves like a historical report (e.g., many contacts can enter the queue, but longest current wait will take some time to reflect the problem). This report gives context to the number of contacts in queue. For example, if there are far more contacts in queue than normal, but longest current wait is modest, you are at the beginning of a downward trend. Now is the time to react. 3. SERVICE LEVEL, AVERAGE SPEED OF ANSWER, AVERAGE TIME TO ABANDONMENT AND OTHER MEASURES OF THE QUEUE AND CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR. These reports provide additional context to the number of contacts in queue and longest current wait. For example, if service level is low, but there are few or no contacts in queue, you have addressed the problem and service level will begin to climb. Don’t sweat it. 4. AGENT STATUS. This real-time report indicates how many agents are available and what modes they are in. I generally place agent status after other reports because it can be difficult to interpret unless you know something about the queue. For instance—it doesn’t matter if few agents are handling contacts if there aren’t many contacts to handle. In that case, you would want agents to be working on other tasks. In the end, you should monitor and interpret these reports together. With the right training on what real-time information means and the activity it is conveying, experienced agents and supervisors can scan and make sense of the updates quickly. ✽✽✽ Monitoring Real-Time Reports"

Escalation plan... ✽✽✽ Display Thresholds Most ACD and wall display systems allow you to establish various priority thresholds. For example, you can color-code information yellow when the queue begins to back up and red when it’s in really bad shape. The problem is that the thresholds are often set arbitrarily. Additionally, agents often don’t understand what is expected of them at different threshold levels. If that’s the case, real-time information will raise everyone’s stress level. And your agents might feel as if it’s their fault that they can’t clear up the queue. To avoid this, proper programming and training are necessary: ▪ Generally, the first threshold should be set for one contact in queue. Agents should proceed normally, and no tactical adjustments are required. ▪ The second threshold should indicate that there are more contacts in queue than the average expected for the desired service level (see “Q2” in Chapter 7). Routine adjustments, such as postponing flexible work, should be made to get the contacts answered. ▪ The next threshold should indicate that there are more contacts in queue than the agents can realistically handle. In this case, more extensive real-time tactics (e.g., bringing in reinforcements or triaging the work) are required. You can program many of today’s systems to adjust thresholds dynamically as workloads and staffing levels change (10 contacts in queue may be no problem during a fully staffed shift, but would be a nightmare for two agents handling work at 3 a.m.). The most important thing is understanding where the information comes from and what it takes into account, so that those interpreting it can make good decisions. Considering All Channels Ever had this happen? Someone looks at the real-time reports and everything is fine, so he or she decides to unplug and begin work on a project or take a break.

Most large or multi-site centers have a designated “traffic control” person (or small team) coordinating activities. The traffic controller’s authority can range from making informed suggestions on priorities to flatly dictating what can and can’t happen at any given time. This responsibility should include the full range of channels. There’s a balance here, though. If you pull agents from response time work (e.g., email, social media messages that can be deferred) to handle service level (e.g., calls, chat), customers who sent email or social media messages might begin calling. If you don’t have coordination across systems, you could be handling the same customer inquiry twice (or more!). In the worst case, the answers given to customers could be inconsistent, creating confusion and further work (and, frankly, making the organization look a bit silly). Whatever the size of your contact center, you’ll need someone with a view of the whole landscape in order to effectively monitor changing conditions. This person may also produce and interpret intraday forecasts (see Chapter 6) and make adjustments to system or network thresholds. Implementing a Workable Escalation Plan Regardless of what channels you are supporting, you will need to make appropriate tactical adjustments as conditions change.

Most contact centers use a tiered approach. This list is not exhaustive and not every option will be available. I encourage you to explore the options available to your center. Then prioritize them into tiers for busy times and tiers for slow times and define when you could/would use each. Level 1 The first level of action involves routine, common-sense adjustments that enable you to get the contacts handled. Agent status becomes the focus, and many use a variation of the time- honored phrase “Everybody help a customer!” This is generally directed toward people on the floor who are not currently handling contacts. At this level, agents make routine adjustments to work priorities. Flexible tasks are postponed. If you have agents handling contacts that are not as time-sensitive as service level contacts—such as email, outbound calls, or data entry—they can be temporarily re-assigned. You might also automatically overflow contacts to agents in other groups (who are, of course, trained to handle those specific types of contacts)."

Level 2 and Beyond If the workload still outpaces the staff required to handle it, the contact center can move on to more significant real-time alternatives. For example, it may be reasonable to reassign agents from one group to another. In omnichannel environments with well-integrated channels, it may make sense to parse out and prioritize channels (e.g., phone or chat over email). This typically happens through automated system changes, based on criteria that you determine and program ahead of time. A related tactic is to prioritize high-value or urgent contacts—though caution is in order to ensure other contacts don’t languish too long (see Chapter 9). In omnichannel environments with well-integrated channels, it may make sense to parse out and prioritize channels. Another possible Level 2 activity is to change system announcements so that they offload what would otherwise be routine contacts. Utilities use messages such as, “We are aware of the power outage in the Bay Ridge area. We hope to have power restored by 11 a.m. We apologize for the inconvenience. If you need further assistance, please remain on the line and one of our representatives will be with you momentarily.” More routinely, contacts can be directed elsewhere: “If you would like current arrival and departure information, press or say one…” Some centers also give customers the ability to check"

We apologize for the delay and will be with you just as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.” This tactic will backfire if it’s overused or stretches the truth. (And yes, the message “we are experiencing unusually heavy call volumes …” has been abused and overused.) You might also be able to improve circumstances by changing routing thresholds between groups or sites. Most of today’s routing systems use sophisticated programming logic, based on thresholds you determine in advance. But remember: those thresholds will need to be adjusted as circumstances dictate.

But it must be well coordinated, because if no supervisors are available when agents need help, the situation could deteriorate further.

Some centers take messages for a later callback, a capability that is greatly facilitated by virtual queue technologies (see Chapter 4). However, this approach doesn’t work well in all cases. Potential challenges include: How do you ensure that the callbacks are timely if you’re busy now? What is your policy when you reach the customer’s voicemail?

In the example, you have more agents than needed early tomorrow morning and fewer than required later in the morning.

Some centers have found that repositioning the first delay announcement can lower abandonment. For example, if the delay announcement is normally set to play just after a contact enters a queue, moving the threshold out to provide additional rings can buy your agent group additional seconds to get to customers before they become fast clear-downs. Also, because most customers don’t feel that they are in a queue until they hear the announcement, they may wait longer."

And keep in mind, this technique will actually worsen average speed of answer and reduce service level. But you have a higher value in mind: get to as many customers as possible before they give up. For that, you’ll want to consider every alternative possible. You may also be able to reduce abandonment by adjusting the position of a second announcement. For example, if average time to abandonment is 50 seconds and the second delay announcement is set for 60 seconds, you might hang on to more customers by adjusting it to play earlier. This is psychology, pure and simple, and the purpose of the second delay announcement is to give customers who are about to abandon renewed hope that you will get to them: “We apologize for the delay; thank you for continuing to hold…”"

    "paragraph": "The first and second delay announcements are valuable, but you’ll need to use good judgment with repeating announcements, or they can make things worse. Keep in mind that customers often have you on speakerphone or are using a headset while they work on other things. (Once shunned by the general public, headsets are becoming de rigueur in the smartphone era.) Remember, they have to mentally tune in every time the announcement is played. Repeating announcements are repeating interruptions. “Yeah, I know this call is important and that you’ll be with me momentarily. You’ve told me eight times so far.” That said, if subsequent announcements are interesting and valuable, they can be helpful in minimizing abandonment. I recall calling an airline to sort out some changes to a complex itinerary. They were backed up due to serious weather-related disruptions in their flight network, and various announcements covered such topics as: baggage policies, what can be carried on, vacation packages, the airline’s mobile app, updates to the frequent flyer program, etc. The announcements were all different, and (even though I was familiar with the information) were interesting and well-timed. For this airline in this situation, it was a good approach. When considering a similar approach, let common sense and your company’s personality and brand be your guide. (See the discussion on customer access strategy, Chapter 2.) Extreme Alternatives What if things are really rough? What if you get more contacts than expected and have exhausted all other alternatives? Should you continue to let customers into the queue? The"

    "paragraph": "choices, neither ideal, are to give callers busy signals (or limit “queue depth,” as some put it) or let customers enter a long queue, only to abandon anyway. Some centers could never consider using busy signals. Emergency services are a notable example. But for others, busy signals may occasionally be acceptable. Customers who get busy signals are more likely to make immediate and repeated attempts to reach you than those who abandon. Busy signals are far less common in today’s contact centers, but they remain enticing to some managers because they make reports look better and take the pressure off of agents. Some centers depend on them as a crutch for inadequate staffing. It probably goes without saying, but that’s poor customer service, and it defeats the mission of the contact center. This tactic should only be used in extreme or short-lived situations. Finally, there is the option to end all options: closing the center. During precipitous declines, times of national or world crises, and other such conditions, stock exchanges will suspend trading (the very thing they’re there to enable). In the world of contact centers, Zappos (which has built a brand on delivering outstanding service) once temporarily stopped all calls and resorted to email in order to handle the workload deluge caused by a hacking incident that forced the company to change customer passwords. Yes, this last-resort alternative is completely out of alignment with the contact center’s mission to provide access. But a situation that forces you to consider such a drastic approach can happen, no matter how well you’ve planned. The message here is: do everything you can to prepare for the workloads you will need to handle. Then, if things go awry, deploy the options you have, scaled for the severity of the situation."

    "paragraph": "I t’s often said, “What gets measured gets done.” I believe that’s an over-simplification. The information produced in a contact center in any given week could cover a small parking lot, and I’ve seen organizations measure lots of things, yet not make sustained improvements. I am convinced that success is a matter not only of measuring the right things, but also building a supporting culture, removing roadblocks, and ensuring that day-to-day activities support the organization’s mission. In this chapter, we’ll look at important definitions, then identify some of the most common metrics in use today. We’ll discuss the objectives and metrics that matter most, and some common pitfalls to avoid. Lastly, I’ll summarize a process for effective reporting. Key Definitions There are terms related to measures and objectives that have important distinctions in meaning. MEASURE: A fundamental, quantifiable unit, such as time, length, amount, or size. Examples include the time it took to process a claim, and number of customers served. METRIC: Quantifiable values that often comprise more than one measure. For example, average cost of a service interaction incorporates both costs and the number of interactions. GOAL: The point of arrival. For example, if a performance objective is to cut turnover in half, and it is currently 16 percent, the goal is 8 percent turnover. PERFORMANCE TARGET: An interim improvement point at a specific point in time; a “checkpoint” to reassess progress and correct the action or work plans necessary to reach the final goal. STANDARD: The requirements, specifications, guidelines, or characteristics established for customer service. PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE: Usually stated as a quantifiable goal that must be accomplished within a given set of constraints, such as a specified period of time or by a given date (e.g., improve customer satisfaction by 10 points within one year)."

    "paragraph": "Metrics in contact centers can be broadly divided into a handful of categories, including: ▪ Quality ▪ Accessibility ▪ Operational efficiency ▪ Cost performance ▪ Strategic impact Let’s examine common measures within each category. Stick with me here—though this chapter doesn’t represent an exhaustive list, we’ll cover quite a few. Getting a snapshot of the many alternatives from which to choose is a good start to selecting metrics and objectives that make sense for your organization. Before we go through the summary, it’s worth noting that many metrics can logically fit into more than one category. Consider agent turnover. Is it a measure of efficiency (newer agents tend to be less efficient), cost performance (it is costly to replace agents), or strategic impact (agent tenure has an impact on results)? How you categorize measures is not as important as getting them on the table so that you can make sensible choices about which to use and how. Quality Common measures related to quality include: CONTACT QUALITY. Assigns a value to the quality of individual interactions. Criteria generally include such things as interpreting customer requirements correctly, entering data accurately, providing the correct information, accurate coding, and capturing needed and useful information. Contact quality is appropriate in all environments as both a high-level indicator of the center’s performance and a specific objective for agents and supervisors. Data typically comes from samples via quality observations or recording contacts and from customer surveys. Quality is discussed further in Chapters 13 and 14. FIRST-CONTACT RESOLUTION. Studies indicate that organizations incur many additional expenses (some hidden and difficult to track) when customer issues are not fully resolved on the first contact. First-contact resolution (FCR) also has a significant impact on customer satisfaction. Analyzing relative increases and decreases in FCR in response to changes in processes, systems and customer requirements can be very informative. Consequently, first- contact resolution is appropriate in all environments as a high-level objective. Components that enable FCR should be built into specific quality objectives for agents— however, because not all aspects are within their control, they must be selected carefully. FCR can be tracked through quality observation samples, customer surveys (asking customers whether the issues were resolved), contact coding based on agent judgment (supported by clear criteria), data on repeat contacts (e.g., from CRM systems), or a combination. I always recommend that FCR be measured both internally and externally."

    "paragraph": "✽✽✽ PERSPECTIVE ON FIRST-CONTACT RESOLUTION First-contact resolution has become a popular metric in recent years. And that’s a good thing: Unresolved contacts are a common source of customer dissatisfaction, and the organization tends to incur many additional expenses (repeat contacts, rework, etc.) when issues are not resolved fully. However, FCR must be implemented carefully. For example: ▪ An exceptionally high FCR rate may point to many simple contacts that can be prevented before they happen (e.g., through better products or improved self-service). ▪ Accurate comparisons with other organizations are difficult because definitions of “resolved contact” vary widely. Focus on developing an appropriate definition for your environment, and stick to it so that you’ll have a stable, baseline measure. ▪ Treat FCR as an organization-wide initiative. When an issue is not resolved on the first contact, the problem is often outside the contact center (e.g., with product or service documentation, functionality, or processes). ▪ Track FCR at least two ways—as an internal measure, and based on whether or not customers feel that their issues were resolved on the first contact (via survey feedback). If these measures don’t closely correlate, find out why. Above all, keep your eyes on customer experience and business results. Remember that FCR is just a supporting indicator, not the endgame. ✽✽✽ ERRORS AND REWORK. As with first-contact resolution, there is significant value in analyzing increases and decreases in errors and rework in response to changes in processes, systems, and customer requirements. Measures of errors and rework are appropriate in all environments, and their specific components are often built into quality objectives for agents (variables must be selected carefully because not all errors are within their control). Data may come from quality observation or recording, CRM systems, analytics, contact coding or other sources. See Chapter 13. Accessibility Common measures related to accessibility include: CONTACTS BY CHANNEL. These are simply measures of the number of contacts by channel: phone, chat, social media, self-service, text, email (etc.), and when these contacts occur. If there are customer communities associated with your products and services, it’s a good idea to assess that activity and determine how many issues are resolved within the forums versus those that require agent assistance. You should also track the average handle times (AHTs) associated with different kinds of agent-assisted contacts so that you have a complete picture of workload by channel. This is essential data for forecasting, and it also is useful as a high-level indication of relative"

SERVICE LEVEL AND RESPONSE TIME. Establishing service level and response time objectives is a necessary step in ensuring that the organization is accessible through whatever channel customers use. Real-time reports are also necessary for tactical adjustments. If multiple “exchanges” (back-and-forth communication between agent and customer, common in technical support) occur, you’ll also need to track overall time to resolution. Service level is available directly from routing systems, social media management tools, and workforce management systems. Response time reports may come from sources such as ACDs or related routing systems (e.g., email response management systems), workforce optimization systems, case management tools, social media systems, or, potentially, other sources. (See Chapters 4 and 7 for detailed discussions on service level and response time.) AVERAGE SPEED OF ANSWER (ASA). ASA is often misinterpreted as a “typical” experience, but the average is skewed by many customers who get answered before the ASA and some who wait far longer than the ASA (see discussion on this topic in Chapter 4). ASA has important operational applications; for example, it is a component of trunk load (Chapter 7). Data on ASA is available from the same systems that provide information on service level. ABANDONED AND BLOCKED CONTACTS. Abandoned contacts and those that are blocked through busy signals or busy messages are generally caused by insufficient staffing or insufficient system resources. They should be considered supporting information to service level and response time reports, not primary objectives (see Chapter 4). Data on abandoned contacts is available directly from ACD or workforce management reports or from servers handling specific types of contacts, such as chat. Reports on busy signals may come from the ACD (if using ACD- controlled busies), the local telephone company or the interexchange (long-distance) company. See Chapter 6. LONGEST DELAY. Also referred to as oldest contact, this figure gives you the longest amount of time a customer had to wait before reaching an agent or abandoning. It is appropriate in all environments as supporting information to service level and response time objectives, and it is available from the same sources that provide service level data. Operational Efficiency Common measures related to efficiency include: FORECAST ACCURACY. Forecasting the workload accurately is a high-leverage activity and is fundamental to managing a contact center effectively. Forecasted versus actual workload is appropriate in all environments as a high-level objective, and (as discussed in Chapter 6) should be reported down to the interval level. It is also used for ongoing tactical adjustments. Forecasted workload is available from the systems used for forecasting—such as the w"

The likelihood or number of times customers contact the organization, typically on an annual basis. Propensity to contact is usually represented as a numerical correlation between total contacts and total customers. For example, 4 would mean that customers contact the organization an average of four times per year. Propensity to contact is fashioned after a similar principle that has been used for many years in economics and marketing: propensity to buy. It is appropriate in any contact center, and it can be helpful in forecasting, gauging relative progress in first-contact resolution, contact avoidance (through simpler or more reliable products and services) or assessing marketing effectiveness. Data comes from the CRM system or sources that track total customers and total contacts. SCHEDULED STAFF VERSUS ACTUAL. This metric compares the number of agents scheduled with the number actually working the schedule. It is appropriate in all environments as a high-level objective for the center and for teams. As with forecasts, reports should show each interval. The purpose of the objective is to understand and improve staff adherence and schedules. Scheduled staff is available from the system used for scheduling (e.g., the workforce optimization system). Actual staff available is reported primarily by the ACD, related routing and management systems, or the workforce optimization system. See Chapters 8 and 14. ADHERENCE TO SCHEDULE. Measures of how much time (and when) during agents’ shifts that they are taking or available to take contacts. Adherence to schedule is appropriate in all environments as a high-level objective, and it also is a common and recommended objective for individuals and teams. The measures are independent of whether the center actually has the staff necessary to achieve a targeted service level and/or response time; they simply gauge how closely agents adhere to schedules. Data generally comes from ACD and workforce management reports. For a detailed discussion, see Chapter 14. AVERAGE HANDLING TIME (AHT). AHT is appropriate in all environments for forecasting, planning, and process improvement activities. However, it is generally not recommended as an agent standard. In many centers, AHT has been increasing as agent-assisted contacts have become more complex, due to the fact that advanced self-service capabilities have offloaded the simpler contacts. Cross-sell and upsell initiatives can also add time to contacts. Relative reductions in AHT through better processes, technologies and training can create significant efficiencies. AHT is available from ACD or related routing systems, as well as workforce management reports. See Chapters 6 and 13. OCCUPANCY AND CONTACTS HANDLED.

Cost Performance Common measures related to cost performance include: COST PER CONTACT. Cost per contact (CPC) is appropriate in all environments as a high-level metric (generally reported monthly or quarterly). However, it must be interpreted correctly. An increase in CPC can, in some cases, be a good sign (e.g., process improvements may result in fewer contacts, spreading fixed costs over fewer contacts and driving up cost per contact). Volume of contacts comes from ACD reports, and potentially other systems that track contacts. Cost data comes from several sources, including payroll (for staffing costs), budgets (for equipment, building depreciation, etc.), and telecommunications reports (for network costs). AVERAGE CONTACT VALUE. Average contact value is appropriate for revenue- generating environments, such as reservation centers and retailers, where contacts have a measurable value. It is typically reported quarterly or monthly, but sometimes more frequently. Many organizations incorporate and track cross-sell and upsell results. Average contact value is challenging to apply (and generally not recommended) in centers where the value of contact is difficult to measure (e.g., customer service centers and technical support). Revenue information comes from any report that includes revenue generated by the contact center—sales reports, total orders, CRM system reports, etc. Volume of contacts requires reports from the ACD or related routing systems, along with the workforce optimization system. REVENUE. As with average contact value, measures of revenue are appropriate for revenue-generating environments and can be reported quarterly, monthly, daily, or for other specific time periods. Results are often correlated with other variables, such as contact center costs, market conditions and revenues through other channels within the organization (e.g., retail or the direct sales force) to gauge the contact center’s impact on the organization’s profits. Revenue information comes from any report that includes revenue generated by the contact center, such as sales reports, CRM system reports, etc. BUDGETED TO ACTUAL EXPENDITURES. Often called variance reports, these measures illustrate the differences between projected and actual expenditures for various budget categories (see example in Chapter 10). They are appropriate in all environments as high-level metrics, assuming they are considered within the context of changing workload variables and contact center responsibilities. They are generally produced both quarterly and annually, and they may be available monthly (or more often in some environments). Budget versus actual information can be formulated from corporate accounting systems, workforce optimization systems, or customized applications. OBJECTIVES FOR OUTBOUND. Outbound mea"

    "paragraph": "are appropriate and necessary in environments that include outbound contacts. Strategic Impact Common measures related to strategic impact include: EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT. Studies have demonstrated that customer satisfaction and loyalty increase as agent engagement increases. Results of surveys to gauge agent engagement should be compared with employee engagement in other parts of the organization. Data is generally captured via anonymous surveys, and it can be augmented by focus groups and one-on- one interviews. See Chapters 14 and 16. TURNOVER. Retention is an increasingly important metric as contact centers become more complex and agent skills and experience requirements escalate. Reductions in turnover typically can be translated into financial savings, overall improvements in quality and productivity, and higher levels of strategic contribution. Turnover reports are often produced monthly (calculated on an annualized basis) and should be categorized as voluntary (they decide to leave), involuntary (they are forced to leave), or internal (which is often positive, as it could mean a promotion or strategic move to another area). I also suggest you look at when it occurs—see Chapter 14. Data is captured and reports generated from human resources information systems (HRIS) and/or workforce management systems. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND LOYALTY. Measuring customer satisfaction or related perceptions of service is necessary and appropriate in all environments and has the greatest value when trended over time and correlated with other measures and developments (e.g., what impact do changes in policies, services and processes have on customer satisfaction?). Data can come from surveys, focus groups, product and service reviews, social media posts, and other sources. Customer loyalty is usually viewed through measures of repeat business over time (improved “wallet share”), cross-sells and upsells. See this chapter for discussions of customer satisfaction, customer effort score, and net promoter score. Also see Chapters 2 and 13. SENTIMENT TRENDING. Sentiment analysis focuses on the nature of customer comments about a company’s products, services, and reputation. It is an important aspect of social media customer service; with speech and text analytics tools it can be applied to interactions captured through virtually any channel. Sentiment can be broadly categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. Deeper levels of analysis can correlate findings with changes in services and products, competitive trends, customer demographics and other variables. STRATEGIC VALUE. Measures and objectives related to strategic value seek to identify, quantify, track, improve and communicate the contact center’s return on investment (ROI) and impact on other business units.

While revenue- and profit-related metrics will not apply to non-commercial organizations (e.g., government and not-for-profit), the contact center’s impact on things like innovation, quality and customer satisfaction applies in any environment. Reports are generally a combination of examples and analysis, and data comes from a variety of sources. See detailed discussions in Chapters 10 and 13. This list is a starting point. Literally hundreds of other metrics—or combinations thereof— exist. Let your needs, objectives, and imagination lead to other possibilities for consideration. 7 Essential Areas of Focus Given the sheer number of possibilities, and the constant change in the business environment, many managers are looking for guidance on objectives and standards. Where do we stand? What are others doing? What performance is good enough? What will please customers? What is “world-class”? These are reasonable questions, and you should be asking them. But let’s start with a basic truth: ultimately, you will need to establish metrics and objectives that are right for your organization. That involves learning all you can about the process of establishing contact center objectives and how variables are interrelated, developing a solid customer access strategy, and tying it to your organization’s overall strategic objectives, and then establishing the metrics and objectives that make sense for you. “The test of any policy in management…is not whether the answer is right or wrong, but whether it works.\" PETER F. DRUCKER “Okay,” you might be saying. “I agree with the notion of choosing objectives that are right for our organization. Still … help me get started. Which measures absolutely, positively must be in place?” Fair enough. There are seven categories of measures that every contact center should have (we’ll discuss areas of focus for individual agents in Chapter 14). I recommend you view them as building blocks, from most tactical to most strategic. And I’ll discuss them in that order, from the bottom up."

    "paragraph": "FORECAST ACCURACY. If you don’t have an accurate prediction of the workload coming your way, it’s almost impossible to deliver efficient, consistent service and achieve high levels of customer satisfaction. That’s true for any channel—phone, chat, social media, and others. SCHEDULE FIT AND ADHERENCE. If you have a good handle on the workload, you can build accurate schedules that ensure the right people are in the right places at the right times. This is best managed from the bottom up, with ample buy-in from agents, and it is an important enabler to everything else you’re trying to accomplish. SERVICE LEVEL AND RESPONSE TIME. These objectives are really just outcomes— the result of forecasting the workload and matching it with the right resources. If customer contacts don’t get to the right places at the right times, little else good can happen. Establishing service level and response time objectives is key to ensuring that the organization is accessible wherever and whenever customers choose to interact. QUALITY AND FIRST-CONTACT RESOLUTION. Quality is the link between contact- by-contact activities and the organization’s most important objectives. First-contact resolution is essentially an extension of quality—a tangible result of getting quality right. Quality measures should be applied to every type of customer interaction. EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT. Employee engagement strongly impacts customer experience, and it is an essential measure in any environment. Agent engagement often has a definable, positive correlation with retention, productivity, and quality. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND LOYALTY. Customer satisfaction is essential in all environments. It has the greatest value as a relative measure and in conjunction with other metrics (e.g., what impact do changes in policies, services and processes have on customer satisfaction?). Customer loyalty is usually viewed through the totality of the customer’s relationship with the business. Robust methodologies such as net promoter score or customer effort score can provide deeper insight into improvement opportunities, and a baseline for benchmarking (see Should You Have an Overall KPI, below). STRATEGIC VALUE. What contributions does the contact center make to product innovations, revenue, marketing initiatives, and other business objectives? Strategic measures are often focused on examples of impact in these and related areas, fueled by listening, engaging, and learning from customer interactions. See Chapters 10 and 13. Other metrics and objectives should be driven by your organization’s mission and objectives. For example, many customer service environments focus on customer satisfaction, efficiency issues and cost measures. Sales environments often base key objectives on revenue, cross-sell, upsell and customer retention activities. And encouraging the use of self-service systems or customer communities and preventing contacts before they happen (e.g., by working with other business units to simpl"

    "paragraph": "of opportunity for many organizations. ✽✽✽ TRUE OPTIMIZATION As contact centers have developed and matured, there has been a lot of attention on “optimization.” To many executives, optimization is synonymous with driving costs out of the business—moving contacts to lower-cost channels (self-service, etc.), reducing human contact with the customer, and driving down handling times. “This is all wrong,” says Mary Murcott, who’s led large contact centers for DHL, American Express, Budget Rent a Car, and others. “This is not optimization; this is driving a distorted view of efficiency even further down the current wayward road.” According to Murcott, true optimization requires moving away from “ancillary measurements,” such as cost per contact, and instead focusing on customer loyalty. I agree 100%, and that is a theme throughout this book. The best contact centers are passionately focused on customer experience. They enable their organizations’ personalities to shine through. And you can see it in customer loyalty, agent engagement, and great business results. ✽✽✽ Should You Have an Overall KPI? Many successful leaders establish an overall metric that reflects customer experience. I think that’s a wise move, but it’s important to do so with a caution in mind. There are several common methods you can choose from when establishing an overall KPI, including customer satisfaction, net promoter score (NPS) and customer effort score (CES). The idea is to have an easy way for anyone to see how things are going. To liken it to sports, the actions your team takes represent what’s happening on the field. The metric provides the score. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. Surveys that measure customer satisfaction, or “CSAT” as it’s sometimes called, are one common approach. They are based on variations of the question “How satisfied are you?” or “How would you rate your experience?” CSAT is not a measure of customer loyalty, which is what we’d really love to know (but only behavior can truly gauge loyalty). And it’s tough to use CSAT for benchmarking because specific approaches vary widely. But it’s so common that you may already have years’ worth of data within your organization that can serve as a baseline. NET PROMOTER SCORE. Net promoter score (NPS) is another popular approach, and it’s based on the survey question “How likely is it that you will recommend us to others?” Input is provided on a ten-point scale, with 10 being very likely to recommend. In calculating the score, 9s and 10s are considered to be promoters, 7s and 8s are neutral and 6s and below are detractors. The overall net promoter score is then expressed as an absolute number between -100 and +100, which is the difference between the percentage of promoters and detractors. So if you have"

    "paragraph": "75% promoters and 20% detractors, the NPS will be 55. Net promoter scores above 0 are considered good; I love to see scores above 50, which are excellent. USAA, Patagonia, Fidelity Investments, and Apple had scores well above 50 in a recent report. Some critics question whether NPS can identify specific improvement opportunities. But it’s used by over two thirds of Fortune 500 companies, so it can be a good basis for comparison. CUSTOMER EFFORT SCORE. Customer effort score (CES) is emerging as an alternative to customer satisfaction and net promoter score. It’s based on the question “How easy was it to resolve your issue?” Responses are captured on a seven-point scale—7 being very easy. Research by the Corporate Executive Board (CEB) shows customer effort to be a strong predictor of customer loyalty. It’s also appropriate for service in organizations that have no competition, such as a government agency. Let me offer a couple of cautions when using any of these alternatives. First, measures of customer experience don’t have much value unless you know what’s driving them. So, they are best viewed along with other metrics. Verbatim comments also can be very helpful (and with large sets of data, analytics applications can be a great help in identifying themes and pain points). Second, ensure that overall scores are not the only thing you—or senior executives—look at. Be sure to also follow customer behavior. Do they continue to buy? Do they try new products? What are they saying about you in social media channels? The right leadership approach is so important. Remember, you’re not trying to produce scores; you want results. You want a real understanding of the impact and value of the contact center, and these survey scores are just part of the picture. (See Navy Federal Credit Union Leaves Scores Behind, Chapter 14). ✽✽✽ FROM METRICS TO VALUES AT HERSHEY There was a time we emphasized a lot of metrics at Hershey Entertainment & Resorts (where I served at that time as Manager, Training & Guest Experience). But we also were aware that a key element of employee engagement is making a connection between work and each employee’s intrinsic values. So we came to the conclusion that we should put more focus on living out our values—we believed good results (including in our metrics) would follow. These efforts led to a program called “Legacy Checks.” Our intent was for our employees to live, breathe, and genuinely believe in our four core values—Own, Anticipate, Delight and Inspire. Rather than just posting values on a wall, we defined what it looked like to embody each value—with co-workers, customers, and in everyday work. We implemented an on-the-spot recognition program to reward people for demonstrating our values in their day-to-day work. This included a hand-written note, was tied to a monetary reward, and explicitly outlined the positive behavior and associated core value. Beyond the Legacy Checks, we used these values to guide the decisions that w"

Our employees authentically served customers with the company’s values as their guiding light, our leaders made decisions based on true business priorities, and we delivered exceptional experiences for our customers. We could see the positive results in both customer loyalty and employee engagement. And yes, in our metrics as well. In short, we focused on values rather than metrics. That made all the difference."

    "paragraph": "By Justin Robbins, JM Robbins & Associates ✽✽✽ Avoiding Common Pitfalls In the 1960s, as mainframe computers were entering the business world—and inspiring much awe—sociologist William Bruce Cameron observed that it would be nice if everything could be represented in numbers and “run through an IBM machine.” But he warned, “not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.” It’s a quotation sometimes attributed to Albert Einstein, and though the source may not be clear, the message certainly is. And it’s fair warning. You have to be mindful about the metrics you establish, how much you read into them, and how you use them to guide decisions. Here are some common “metric pitfalls” to avoid: HAVING BLIND SPOTS. I recall meeting with executives of a large firm that provides HR and payroll services. They had won awards for the quality of their contact center service. But they were seeing some troubling downward trends in customer satisfaction. Why? What was wrong? As we discussed the full range of service channels (e.g., social media, mobile apps, and others), I pulled up their Facebook site on a laptop projecting to a screen at the front of the room —and heard a collective gasp. Alongside well-intentioned and upbeat messages from the company was a string of posts from a frustrated customer who needed help with a simple password reset, but had received no response. His posts were in all-capital letters; it was clear he was upset. The company didn’t have a service presence (let alone metrics!) in some of the channels their customers expected. It was time to broaden the reach of what they were measuring. ESTABLISHING TOO MANY METRICS. Another pitfall is having far too many metrics, along with the message that they somehow must all be tracked and managed. There is a tendency for that to happen: someone sees an improvement opportunity or operational gap, believes that a report could provide visibility, and adds it to the mix. However, there’s often a lack of similar efforts to cut down and eliminate reports that aren’t helpful. Or to differentiate between supporting metrics and those that are most important. Clutter has a significant downside. If there are too many metrics, your team’s focus will be diluted. PAINTING AN OVERLY OPTIMISTIC PICTURE. Reporting the contact center in the best possible light can undermine success. There are a lot of ways to produce reports so that the center looks as effective as possible to senior management. However, if you mask serious resource deficiencies or problems with processes, the center is less likely to get the resources and support it needs. That, in turn, will undermine your ability to perform (see Chapter 4)."

    "paragraph": "There’s also the related issue of psychology. When upper-level managers see room for improvement, they tend to feel more assured they are getting the whole story (plus, being transparent and presenting the whole picture is the right thing to do). CREATING CONFLICTING MESSAGES. I too often see service metrics that conflict with each other, leaving the team to guess what’s most important. For example, an insurance company recently began focusing on first-contact resolution. This is a wise move, and customers appreciate it; it contributes to true effectiveness. But their cost per interaction began going up, largely for a reason that is not immediately obvious: they have proportionally fewer interactions, because they are preventing repeat and unnecessary work. So fixed costs are being allocated across fewer contacts. Their total costs are going down, and they’ve had to re-educate managers to not look at average cost per contact in a vacuum. It doesn’t tell you everything you need to know."

    "paragraph": "ENCOURAGING THE WRONG BEHAVIOR. An all-too-common pitfall I see is when metrics encourage the wrong behavior. Perhaps you’ve had a service technician say, “Hey, you will receive a survey within the next week, and if you don’t provide a top score, it will reflect on me.” That kind of conversation—begging for scores, as some call it—is awkward for employees and customers. And it defeats much of the value in what you can learn about the customer’s experience. TRYING TO MATCH “BENCHMARKS.” As you work toward achieving important objectives, it’s essential that your team recognizes what the metrics are really saying. Don’t get trapped by benchmarks. For example: ▪ Maybe your first-contact resolution rate is lower than what similar organizations say they are achieving; but you might be measuring it more rigorously and/or working to handle easy contacts without the assistance of agents. ▪ Your center’s average handling time (AHT) might be higher than that of other centers. However, if you’re using that time to prevent repeat contacts, refine processes and capture information that can improve products and marketing, your efficiency (and associated costs) may be far better than they are for those other centers. ▪ Your service level or response time objectives may be more modest than others in your industry.

Not if you are aware of these pitfalls, and do the work necessary to leverage the potential of your metrics to drive innovation and improvement. Jeff Rumburg, co-founder of research firm MetricNet, estimates that 100% of organizations have KPIs, 80% can define their KPIs, 30% understand KPI cause and effect, 10% use metrics to continuously improve, and around 5% leverage KPIs for “world-class” performance. I concur with these estimates—there’s a lot of opportunity in many contact centers. Reporting Contact Center Activity Reporting contact center activity to senior-level management and others in the organization can seem like a daunting task. Contributing to the challenge is the wide variety of activities in a typical center, the reality of senior management not having the time to pore over detailed reports, and the fact that summary reports often gloss over important information. Consequently, many diligently prepared reports either go unread or are misunderstood. Clearly, good communication doesn’t happen just because detailed information is available. Any manager buried in reports yet struggling to convey basic realities can attest to this. As with budgets, the process you establish to communicate ongoing contact center activity is as important as the information itself. The following steps can help you identify and prepare meaningful reports and ensure that they are understood: 1. DETERMINE YOUR OBJECTIVES. What are the objectives for the reports? In other words, what should other managers know about the contact center or the information it has acquired, and why? To find the answers, assemble a team of managers from across the organization for a working discussion. (And don’t forget to include other members of the contact center team, such as supervisors, team leads, and agents.) General areas of interest usually include: ▪ Customer experience and voice of the customer ▪ Quality measurements ▪ Access alternatives and workload trends ▪ Contributions to other business units ▪ Costs and revenues ▪ Queue reports (such as service level and abandonment) ▪ Resource utilization and requirements (e.g., staffing and scheduling needs) From these major categories, important measurements will emerge. It’s often useful to preface this exercise with a question like, “In an ideal world, what would we really want to know"

    "paragraph": "2. IDENTIFY SUPPORTING INFORMATION. List the possible reporting alternatives under each of the objectives you identified in the first step. Include information from systems, databases, surveys, other departments, and external sources. The challenge now becomes one of selection. Stephanie Winston, author of the classic book The Organized Executive, advises that a report should not simply collect facts, but serve as a judgment tool for management. To pare down the lists, Winston suggests asking a variety of questions: Is the report really necessary? What questions does it answer? Which reports would you dispense with if you had to pay for them? Could several reports be combined? Will you act on the information to effect change? 3. PUT THE INFORMATION IN A USER-FRIENDLY FORMAT. Once you have a list of desired reports, the next step is to compile them into a simple, understandable format. This often means creating illustrations. For example, simple line charts can illustrate trends that would otherwise appear as hard-to-decipher numbers. Reports that rely on graphs may take more pages, but a five-page report consisting primarily of graphs is often quicker to read and easier to comprehend than two pages of detailed numbers in rows and columns. Look for data that can be combined or contrasted to provide a more complete story (see example). 4. CLARIFY INFORMATION THAT COULD BE MISLEADING. As any seasoned contact center manager has learned, you can make reports show just about whatever you want. For example, you can prop up service level by overflowing contacts to other groups, changing distribution priorities, or taking messages for later callbacks. Or you can provide overall reports for longer timeframes that conceal problematic intervals. Clearly, simply providing high-level reports on service level or quality can be misleading. The reader needs more information."

AHT is 5% higher than projections due to requirements prompted by new legislation. Email and social media contacts have also increased, due to higher-than-expected response to the new marketing campaign. One other variance of note is higher-than-expected internal turnover, resulting in two additional new-hire training classes ($30,000 each). 5. EXPLAIN EXCEPTIONS. There will be points that are clearly out of the norm. Don’t leave your audience guessing. Explain deviations—both what happened and why. Why did wait times go through the roof in early February? A simple footnote can provide the answer: “Power outage in Northeast; workload 40 percent higher than normal.” 6. ADD PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES. Giving recipients a report to read on what happens on Monday mornings versus bringing them into the center to observe what happens is the difference between night and day. You need to do both. Teaching key contact center dynamics to managers outside the center is necessary to create a clear understanding of how cross-functional decisions and actions link with the center’s overall effectiveness. And contact center executives need a solid understanding of the concerns, challenges, and objectives in other areas of the organization. This mutual understanding forms a strong and essential foundation for effective reporting and communication. 7. ORGANIZE AN ONGOING FORUM FOR ACTING ON THE INFORMATION. Presenting data in a clear, concise, and actionable format is a start. But the sharing of reports must be followed by a forum for discussing and acting on the information. This becomes the primary opportunity to turn information into sound business decisions. When metrics show underlying improvement, be sure to acknowledge contributions and celebrate!

    "paragraph": "T he ongoing need to improve quality and performance has led to numerous management movements over the years. By the mid-20th century, the world had seen the rise of scientific management (Frederick Taylor), human relations, inspection, safety, statistical quality control, and others. More recent examples include Six Sigma, management by objectives (MBO), total quality management (TQM), reengineering, Kaizen, and Lean Six Sigma. So, today’s generation of quality, performance, and customer experience initiatives is building on a rich history. Naturally, new ideas and methods will follow. But some core themes have emerged from these management advances—principles that are today guiding developments in contact centers. My purpose here is to make sense of these principles and to (hopefully!) inspire you to see the vast opportunity that exists to innovate and improve. As you drive the right kind of change, everybody wins—your customers, your employees, and your organization. 1. Quality Must Be Based on Customer Needs and Expectations The need to identify and address customer expectations stems from a widely accepted principle: improvements in customer satisfaction lead to increased customer loyalty, better business results and a stronger brand reputation. That’s why the customer access strategy must be based on the ten customer expectations (see Chapter 2). Consider the old adage about building the best-quality horse buggy in town: it doesn’t matter if no one wants it. ✽✽✽ TEN KEY CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS (no specific order) 1. Be accessible 2.

Be socially responsible and ethical ✽✽✽ A lesser-known but similarly powerful principle is also at work: meeting customer expectations often translates into higher levels of service that are delivered at proportionally lower costs. Yes, more loyal customers save the organization lots of marketing dollars. But there’s more to it than that. Take the simple issue of being courteous (one of the ten primary customer expectations). In today’s environment, that means such things as: don’t make customers repeat the same information, don’t transfer them around, and don’t make them go over their account history again. Customers don’t know (nor should they care) that these guidelines require processes and systems that deliver relevant information to the right agent at the right time. To them, it’s simply a matter of courteous service."

    "paragraph": "To the organization, however, meeting this expectation almost always translates into service that is more cost effective to deliver. Being responsive, handling contacts right the first time, relaying expectations to customers—everybody wins, including customers, employees, and shareholders. Three key questions that should always be part of your decision-making process are: What are your customers’ expectations? Are you meeting or exceeding them? Are you using the fewest possible resources to do so? Don’t guess at what your direction should be. Listen to what customers are saying in surveys, social media posts, feedback sites—doing everything you can to put yourself in their shoes. Above all, take every opportunity to listen to, engage with and learn from customers during interactions. ✽✽✽ SEEING THINGS AS YOUR CUSTOMERS DO Many successful leaders are uneasy with depending on surveys and aggregated data to tell them what’s really happening with customers. They want to put themselves in their customers’ shoes. They want to see their organization, products, employees and competitors as their customers do. The late Herb Kelleher, founder of Southwest Airlines, made spending time with customers and employees both a regular practice and a priority. He’d fly different routes, wander through airports, and strike up conversations. Howard Schultz, former chairman and CEO of Starbucks, spent significant time in stores, which helped him see opportunities (such as investing in shorter espresso machines so baristas can have eye contact with customers). Many leaders find that spending time with customers feels awkward at first. But for the most effective among them, this commitment becomes the norm; it becomes an indispensable part of their perspective and decisions. ✽✽✽ 2. Quality and Service Level Work Together Quality and service level are inextricably associated with, and complementary to, each other. As discussed in Chapter 4, service level is an enabler. As service level deteriorates, more customers will verbalize their criticisms when they finally do reach an agent. Agents spend valuable time apologizing. Handling times go up. Burnout increases. Morale and turnover take a hit, leading to an increase in recruitment and training costs. When you consider the components of a quality contact, the complementary relationship between quality and service level becomes evident. Think through how each applies in your environment. What if data is not entered correctly? What if the customer doesn’t have confidence the contact was handled correctly? What if you didn’t capture useful information from the interaction?"

Costs, of course, go up. When service level is low, agents are working one interaction after another due to congestion in the queue. Customers begin telling them in no uncertain terms about the tough time they had getting through. (If you haven’t had the opportunity, I encourage you to experience it: go handle some contacts that begin, “I hate your system” or “Everyone must be on break, huh?”) Under this kind of pressure, any of us are bound to make more mistakes. These errors further contribute to repeat contacts and time spent on things that would otherwise be unnecessary. Poor service level becomes a vicious cycle."

If customers don’t receive a reply to a message (email, social media post, etc.) as quickly as expected, or if they don’t receive the correct or expected response, they may send another. Or messages can take on increased urgency: “I sent a message and haven’t received a reply yet …” To visualize the relationship between accessibility and quality, take a look at the implications through the lens of a staffing table (see table, Revisiting Service Level). What percentage of contacts are repeat, or due to waste and rework? And how does this impact call handling time (talk plus after-call work)? How about agents? How many are involved in creating or fixing waste and rework?

The Process Is Where the Leverage Is A process is a “system of causes.” (Note: in the context of quality and process improvement, “system” refers to the system of causes or processes, not a technology.) The contact center itself is a process, a system of causes. It is part of the organization, which is an expansive system of causes. An agent group is a system of causes within the contact center. And each contact comprises a system of causes. The central focus of the process illustrated in the above figure can be any high-level measurement or result that you want to achieve. Note that most of the items are the responsibility of management and the organization, not individual agents. Also note that just about everything is interrelated, so the causes of performance problems are often difficult to isolate and measure. This illustration leads to a principle that is at the heart of the modern quality movement: there is little use urging agents to improve quality without making improvements to the system itself. Many of the things that contribute to quality are beyond their direct control, such as having good training, the right tools, accurate information, and a logical workflow. The system of causes—the process—is where the leverage is."

What levels do you want to raise (or lower)? Where are the innovation opportunities? But tracking results isn’t the same as improving them. To make improvements, you have to work on the factors that cause these outputs to be where they are. In other words, you have to work at a deeper level—the root causes. 4. Fix Root Causes to Make Lasting Improvements Have you ever been part of this conversation: “I thought we fixed that problem! Why are talking about it again?” Chances are, a symptom was addressed, at least temporarily, but the root cause was not fully identified and resolved. Your proof that a problem has been fixed is that it doesn’t recur, or its frequency is reduced dramatically. Without an appropriate approach and supporting tools, identifying root causes is a significant challenge. Consider a recurring problem such as providing incomplete information to customers. Maybe the cause is insufficient information in the CRM or knowledge management systems. Or a need for more training. Or maybe a lack of coordination with other departments. Or agent stress from a chronically high occupancy rate. Or a combination of any of these factors. If the problem is to be fixed, you need to understand its root cause. You can then take the necessary corrective actions. The tools that the quality movement has produced and popularized over the years are helpful in understanding processes and identifying underlying causes. If you’ve had formal training in quality improvement, you are likely well-versed in the use of these tools. My purpose here is to illustrate some ways they can be applied in your contact center—and to encourage you to use them! Root Cause Analysis: Non-Statistical There are two approaches to root cause analysis: non-statistical and statistical. Non-statistical approaches are easy to use and understand—and can be very effective. Five Whys The “five whys” is a simple and often effective technique to identify the root cause.

Why are more accounts falling below the minimum balance? Customers were not aware of the change in required balance.

Flow charts are also excellent communication tools and can help you visualize and understand the steps of a process. (For a simple example, see Which Metrics Become Objectives.) One of the most useful applications for a flow chart is to analyze the steps associated with the contacts you handle. Some think of an interaction as a simple, singular event. Not so! Even a very simple contact consists of many steps. To really understand the process, it is useful to chart what happens, step by step (see Understanding AHT, Chapter 14). Sometimes, a sweeping analysis of the customer journey is helpful. With senior management’s support and direction, representatives from across the company—the contact center, fulfillment, marketing, billing and credit, IT, etc.—can map out interdepartmental and interorganizational processes to identify areas that need to be improved or overhauled. This is a common and necessary part of many customer experience initiatives. Here are a few things to flowchart: ▪ Contacts, step by step ▪ Capturing, sharing, and acting on voice of the customer ▪ The customer journey map Cause-and-Effect Diagram The cause-and-effect diagram, alternatively called a “fishbone diagram” (because of its shape) or Ishikawa diagram (after its creator, Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa), is recognized and used worldwide. It illustrates the relationships between causes and a specific effect you want to study. Preparing a cause-and-effect diagram is an education in itself, and everyone who participates will gain a better understanding of the process. The traditional cause categories are referred to as the 4Ms: manpower, machines, methods, and materials. A variation on these categories—people, technology, methods, and materials/services—works better for contact centers. However, these labels are only suggestions; you can use any that help your group creatively focus on and think through the problem. Possible causes leading to the effect are drawn as branches off the main category. The final step is to prioritize the causes and work on the most prevalent problems first."

You can then work on the common causes by improving both the “system” and the whole process. Special causes show up as points outside of the upper control limit (UCL) or lower control limit (UCL), or as points with unnatural patterns within the limits. A control chart cannot reveal what the problems are. Instead, it reveals where and when special causes occur.

(For an insightful discussion of quality control, the origins of the quality movement, and a look at the colorful life of the late W. Edwards Deming, check out his pivotal work, Out of the Crisis, The MIT Press.) Benchmarking While many of these tools focus on improvements from within, the idea behind benchmarking is that breakthrough ideas often come from the outside (outside the organization and, often, outside your industry). Benchmarking is the process of measuring your products, services, and processes against those of other organizations. It’s important to note that organizations are different enough, even within a given industry, that universally-accepted standards usually don’t exist. Things like labor rates, customer demographics, customer tolerances, network configurations, hours of operation, and the mix of part- and full-time agents vary widely. Further, organizations often interpret performance measurements differently. What is most important is knowing how the results were achieved, not just what the results are."

A general approach to benchmarking can be summarized as follows: DEFINE PROCESSES AND COLLECT PERFORMANCE DATA. This involves getting agreements on processes to be compared and measurements to be used. ANALYZE COLLECTED DATA AND IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES. This includes normalizing the raw data for differences and then identifying the best performers from each category. PREPARE RECOMMENDATIONS. Based on findings, this entails identifying, paring down, and communicating specific recommendations. APPLY FINDINGS. This involves developing a plan to implement improvements and track results. Benchmarking, like other aspects of quality improvement, is most useful as an ongoing effort. What were once cutting-edge practices become the norm. As best practices become generally accepted, they can no longer be considered “best practices” (I always wince a little when I see common practices identified as best practices). ✽✽✽ DON’T FORGET THE OBOES A popular trend in process improvement is the effort to correlate specific contact center activities with overall customer satisfaction. For example, some consulting organizations have been convincing clients to lower service level objectives because their scatter diagrams demonstrate minimal correlation between overall service level and customer satisfaction results. The effort to understand how specific activities and measures influence overall results is laudable. But it can be reckless to claim that you’ve figured out just how much a specific variable affects customer satisfaction. The late Peter Drucker often used an orchestra analogy to remind us that a manager has the task of creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. “A conductor must always hear both the orchestra and the second oboe,” he said. “Can you hear the second oboe?” There’s a fine line here: We need to understand how specific activities influence overall results, but we are being irresponsible if we cut oboes or add trumpets simply because this or that study shows they have X and Y impact on customer satisfaction. As any coach, conductor, or artist knows, there’s more to it than that. ✽✽✽ Small Improvements Lead to Big Returns With any of these tools and methods, there is a danger of getting caught up in the analysis process itself and forgetting to move on to problem resolution. Once you’ve identified problems to tackle, assign responsibilities, provide necessary resources, and make the improvements. Then track progress."

    "paragraph": "Even seemingly small improvements can make a big difference. A government agency learned from frontline agents that constituents (customers) were sharing information in a different way than the system was capturing data. The customer service team worked with IT to redesign the screens and data fields used during interactions. This cut the average time to handle interactions by 3% (which, with an average cost per contact of $9, was 27 cents per contact). Here’s the impact: with 620,000 annual contacts, the value of this improvement was $167,400 every year (3% × $9 × 620,000). The savings exceeded $1 million within six years. 27 cents! Yes, even small changes can really add up. 5. Contact Centers Enable Significant Strategic Value As outlined in the first chapter, customer contact centers have the potential to create value on three distinct levels: efficiency, customer satisfaction and business unit (strategic) value. Level three—working with other business units—is where you can truly begin to leverage the contact center’s potential to deliver strategic value to the organization. As a primary customer touchpoint, the contact center has enormous potential to provide other business units with valuable intelligence and support. This can include input on customers, products, services, and processes. When this information is captured, identified, assimilated, and turned into usable knowledge, it can literally transform an organization’s ability to identify and meet customer expectations. The following list (which I encourage you to use and add to) summarizes the key benefits and support the contact center can provide to other business units. Sales and Marketing ______ Deepens customer relationships ______ Helps recognize and reward loyal customers ______ Helps identify effective campaign strategies ______ Supports segmentation, branding, and personalization ______ Captures customer insight on competitors ______ Frees sales reps and others to be more productive ______ Other: Manufacturing/Operations _____ Pinpoints quality and production problems _____ Provides input on the usability and clarity of products and services _____ Contributes to product documentation and procedures _____ Highlights distribution problems and opportunities _____ Facilitates communication related to capacity or production problems _____ Other: Research and Development (R&D)/Design _____ Provides information on competitive direction and trends"

But those furthest along the continuum are the first to point out that there’s a lot more potential. ✽✽✽ LUTRON’S “INSIGHT CENTER” Lutron is a global electronics company and major player in the Internet of Things (IoT) and connected home markets. Products include control systems for lighting, ceiling fans, shading and others, which can be controlled from smartphones, voice assistants (such as Alexa), and other devices. At a recent ICMI conference, Matt Dixon, advisor and coauthor of The Effortless Experience, and Tim Donchez, Continuous Improvement Director at Lutron Electronics, presented a case study of Lutron’s experience in harnessing strategic value. Lutron’s contact centers handle complex interactions—they come from retail partners, distributors, electricians, architects, individual consumers and others. And they inherently involve products not only from Lutron, but from other companies as well. Tim shared an essential ingredient to success: “We hire great people, and we trust them to use their judgment to serve our customers.” Lutron records calls and uses analytics to better understand the content of those calls, but not with improving frontline performance as the objective. Instead, the goal is to mine the rich feedback customers provide on Lutron’s products, brand, services, installation experiences and (as Matt puts it), “almost every other thing that leaders at Lutron need to make better products and deliver a better experience to their customers.” Tim points to numerous insights that have been gleaned through this approach. For example, a particularly vexing installation problem that drove a lot of calls was solved by addressing some confusing language in the installation instructions. In other examples, the contact center partnered with the engineering team on new product launches, and provided guidance to retail partners on products and services. Tim summarizes the value of the contact center: “We’ve got a line of business partners out the door who want to get access to the data because it allows them to deliver products and exper"

    "paragraph": "Source: “Turning Your Contact Center Into an Insight Center,” by Matt Dixon, ICMI.com ✽✽✽ How do you identify and leverage the potential your contact center has? A number of key lessons have emerged: ▪ Seek first to understand. Develop good working relationships with the individuals who run other areas of the organization. Learn about their goals and objectives and how the contact center might best support their needs. ▪ Build an understanding of the contact center’s role and potential. Ensure that the prevailing perspective is that the role of the center is to serve other parts of the organization, not to point out flaws. ▪ Build a team that is focused on capturing, analyzing, sharing, and using value-added information across the organization. A suggested ratio is that you need one business analyst for every 30 to 50 agents. The ideal ratio depends on many factors, but will become clearer once you get started. ▪ Ensure that quality at the point of customer contact is given the broadest possible definition (e.g., that coaching, quality observation and objectives at the agent level are all considered essential elements of these major strategic opportunities). ▪ Define assumptions and unknowns in reports and data. Ensure that everyone understands where the data comes from and what definitions are in place. Strategic decisions based on misinterpreted reports can be worse than if there were no reports at all. ▪ Get the best tools you can. Analytics and performance management systems can help you analyze content, detect trends and causal factors, and identify improvement opportunities. Get started even if you don’t have these capabilities, but work toward acquiring and building supporting technologies. ▪ Don’t get overwhelmed. There is a ton of information that you could provide to each business unit. Instead of focusing on quantity (by trying to ensure that everything that may be valuable is shared), concentrate on providing the information that is likely to be most useful. Every interaction your center handles provides insight into processes, products, policies, services, customers, and the external environment. You have the opportunity to play a central role in building a stronger organization with better services and products across the board. But it’s a role that must be earned. 6.

Here are eight criteria that can help you make that decision: SAFETY: Customer safety should always be the top priority. FREQUENCY: How often does the issue occur? If you fix the root cause, what’s the potential impact? MAGNITUDE: Whether a customer impact is frequent or not, the magnitude of making or not making an improvement has to be considered. INNOVATION: What kinds of things are on your customers’ wish lists for your products, company, or industry? TIMING: Some issues significantly impact customers, but can wait. Others, even if they are of smaller impact, may need to be handled now. CUSTOMER SEGMENT: This can be tricky because every customer is important. But many organizations do what they can to help their most loyal customers. PREVENTION: A bedrock principle of effectively managing customer feedback is resolving problems before they happen or before they become larger. Where those opportunities exist, they should be priorities. BRAND IMPACT: Brand protection and development is one of the primary objectives of listening to and taking action on customer feedback. Prioritize actions that protect and promote your brand, as well as ones that create customer advocates who will do this for you. In the end, determining what actions to take can be as much an art as a science. But considering this range of criteria—and not just paying attention to squeaky wheels—can lead to much better decisions. My overarching advice: make continuous innovation and improvement an ingrained and essential part of your organization’s culture. Instill the principles covered in this chapter, and stick to them—day after day, month after month, year after year. There is something powerful about consistently focusing on the things that matter most. It’s a never-ending journey. And an exciting one, because it prepares your organization for the unknowns ahead even as it delivers better results today. 7.

As customer expectations are constantly evolving, the definition of quality must also evolve. ‣ Quality and service level work together. Over the long term, good quality has a positive impact on service level (and response time) by reducing waste and rework. And a good service level provides an environment in which good quality can be achieved. ‣ The process is where the leverage is. There is little use in urging agents to improve quality without making improvements to the system of causes (the process). ‣ The tried-and-true methodologies and tools that the quality movement has produced can help find and fix root causes. ‣ Contact centers have enormous potential to deliver strategic value to the organization, through information and intelligence that can be shared with and used in other business units. ‣ Improvements must be ongoing.

Success depends on creating an engaging environment and bringing out the best in everyone who is part of it. But, as many leaders have learned (some the hard way), off-the-shelf prescriptions and simplistic formulas tend to fail. Fortunately, there are principles that don’t change and that you can trust. For example, be consistent and relentlessly focused on the values that matter. Lead by example. Set the right performance expectations. Encourage involvement and work hard to establish good channels of communication. Give people the chance to learn and grow. Expect the best. We’ll look at these and other related principles in this chapter. And we’ll explore key performance objectives, quality observation, calibration, coaching, and training practices. Finally, we’ll look at how to measure and positively manage turnover. Establishing an Engaging Environment When my daughter Grace was 13 years old, she bought a new camera. She had saved for many months and was very excited. But in the weeks that followed, many pictures turned out blurry and I could see her interest fade. We later learned that the camera was faulty and, when made aware, the store immediately replaced it. Then the real magic happened. An employee, Devon, stayed 30 minutes past her shift to help Grace set up and test the new camera. “You’ll LOVE it!” she reassured her. “I have the same model!” This employee was clearly engaged and passionate about her job. And that enthusiasm will likely have a lifelong impact on my daughter’s interest in photography. Employee engagement is a term we all hear and use, but what is it exactly? We know it’s not the same as employee satisfaction. An employee can be satisfied with their job for various reasons—geographical convenience, friendships, compensation—without really being engaged. One good definition of engagement is “the enthusiasm or emotional commitment an employee has to the organization and the work they do.” The impact of employee engagement is incredible. According to research by Gallup,"

    "paragraph": "organizations that are the best in engaging their employees achieve earnings-per-share growth that is more than four times that of their competitors. Other studies show that quality improves, customer loyalty goes up, and employee turnover goes down. The National Business Research Institute (NBRI) identified six traits of engaged employees. They make a great starting place when thinking about your team. Engaged employees: ▪ Believe in their organization ▪ Have the desire to work to make things better ▪ Understand the business context and big picture ▪ Are respectful and helpful to colleagues ▪ Are willing to go the extra mile ▪ Stay up to date with developments in their industry I recommend having a candid discussion with your team, using these traits as a framework. What’s going well? What barriers might be getting in the way? Principles Behind Engagement What do successful contact centers, those with the most engaged employees, have in common? Here’s a summary of principles I’ve observed: WE RESPOND TO A CLEAR, COMPELLING MISSION. A needed first step to creating a motivating environment is to address the “whats” and “whys.” Why do the organization and the contact center exist? What are we trying to achieve? What’s in it for customers? For employees? Shareholders? Other stakeholders? IT’S WHAT YOU DO, NOT WHAT YOU SAY, THAT MATTERS. There are countless organizations that codify their “official” values, but then encourage an entirely different set of behaviors through their policies and actions. For example, delivering great customer experiences may be the stated objective, but insufficient staffing resources or standards that stress volume- oriented production may send conflicting messages. When it comes to influence, actions always win out over words. EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION CULTIVATES TRUST. Communication creates meaning and direction. When good communication is lacking, the symptoms are predictable: conflicting objectives, unclear values, misunderstandings, lack of coordination, confusion, low morale, and employees doing the bare minimum required to get by. To build and maintain engagement, effective leaders keep their teams informed about what’s happening in the organization (see Chapter 16). GOOD TRAINING AND COACHING IS ESSENTIAL. There’s nothing more stressful and frustrating than not knowing what to do in real, live customer service situations (if you’ve"

    "paragraph": "been there, you know what I mean!). Knowing how to approach any situation makes all the difference. Confidence is built by providing robust training and coaching (including role-playing tough scenarios). When I asked an employee about her company’s improved training and coaching, she said, “I went from dreading my day to looking forward to it; I love being a problem solver!” LISTENING ENCOURAGES BUY-IN AND SUPPORT. There is a common myth that great leaders create compelling visions out of their own genius or from some inner creativity that others don’t possess. But those who have studied leadership point out that the visions of some of history’s greatest leaders often came from others. Further, when people have a stake in an idea, they tend to work much harder to bring about its success. WE TEND TO LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS. Think of your own development over the years. Those coaches, teachers or business mentors who believed in you and expected the most probably weren’t the easiest on you. And they may not have won popularity contests. But they believed in you, and you reached a little deeper to live up to their expectations. SINCERE RECOGNITION GOES A LONG WAY. In study after study, participants say that personalized and sincere recognition from their managers—simply being recognized for doing a good job—is a powerful motivator. (Easier said than done, of course. You have to really know what’s going on from top to bottom to get it right … but isn’t that a part of leadership, anyway?) ACCURATE RESOURCE PLANNING IS ESSENTIAL. Yep, in the time-driven contact center environment, this matters a lot. We’ve got to have “the right people in the right place at the right times, doing the right things.” When that doesn’t happen, negative things do: queues build, customers become unhappy, and occupancy goes through the roof. It’s stressful. And, if chronic, it zaps motivation and drains the fun out of the environment. WHO YOU ARE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY TECHNIQUE YOU USE. We trust and perform for leaders who are predictable on matters of principle, and who make their positions known. Unwavering convictions, a sense of fairness, consistency of behavior and enacted values, belief in the capabilities of people—these things have much more impact than any motivational technique ever could. One thing is certain: leaders in organizations that maintain the highest levels of engagement don’t leave it to chance. They know that employees who are interested in and enthusiastic about their work create great results for customers and the organization. Meaningful Work We don’t all look at work the same way. In his book Why We Work, Barry Schwartz summarizes three ways we can relate to work: ▪ Work as a job ▪ Work as a career"

    "paragraph": "▪ Work as a calling Those who view work as a job mainly see it as a paycheck. They don’t receive any kind of reward or fulfillment beyond salary and benefits. Those who view work as a career have a higher level of motivation—they want to get better at what they do, take on new responsibilities, and move up in the organization. Those who view work as a calling are the most motivated—they understand how the work they do makes a positive difference for others. So, a secret to creating an engaging environment is to establish the connection between what your employees do and how it impacts others. Here’s an example. For years, a well-known consumer products company had high turnover in their contact center. Customer feedback was poor, and employees jumped at any chance to move to other jobs. This department was second from the bottom in the annual company-wide survey of employee satisfaction. A new director began by asking the team about their value and purpose. One employee answered him this way: we handle consumer gripes all day … how important can that be? They decided to find out. How could they be more valuable to customers and the company? Some simple analysis revealed that 11% of customer contacts about a specific cleaning product were due to the cap being too hard to remove. Customers would force it off, too often shearing off the spray nozzle. The complaints all went something like this: “Hey, I just spent five bucks on this and I can’t even use it.” The team shared this data with their packaging supplier, who improved the caps. Those contacts went away and many future customers benefited from a better product. That gave the team a glimpse of their potential. In the months that followed, the contact center became involved in marketing, systems improvement, and product development. A senior leader told me that the contact center team had become the “secret sauce” to the company’s research and development. Fast forward a year. Turnover was down to low single digits. Employees were excited. And the department went from second-lowest all the way to second-highest in employee satisfaction. When they saw their true impact on customers, colleagues, and the success of the company, they began to understand their value and potential (no, it wasn’t just handling customer gripes all day). That made all the difference in their sense of worth and motivation. Agent Performance The subject of measuring the performance of individuals has always been hotly debated. And for good reason: performance measurements are usually tied to behavioral expectations and standards, so many issues enter the discussion (e.g., fairness, which measurements are truly under an individual’s control, individual capabilities, drives and motivators, and the effectiveness of the processes in place). I’ve seen a lot of different performance metrics and standards in play. But there are consistent principles in contact centers that get the best results. Let’s look at how the right"

    "paragraph": "expectations and metrics encourage the right behavior. Beware of Contacts Handled There was a day when number of contacts handled was an almost universal productivity measurement. In fact, many managers viewed contacts handled as virtually synonymous with productivity (not something I’ve ever recommended, for reasons we’ll discuss). While there have always been concerns about sacrificing quality for quantity, contacts handled was the usual benchmark for establishing productivity standards, for comparing performance among agents and groups, and for assessing the impact of changes and improvements to the center. As a measure of performance, contacts handled has always been problematic. And not just because quality can suffer when contacts handled is overemphasized. It’s also this: many of the variables that affect contacts handled are out of the agents’ control. These include random contact arrival, contact types, customers’ knowledge and communication abilities, the accuracy of the forecast and schedule, and the adherence to schedule of others in the agent group. ✽✽✽ A QUICK QUIZ Over which factors do agents have control? ✔ Adherence to schedule (their own) ✘ Staff scheduled to handle the workload ✘ Random contact arrival ✘ Distribution of long and short contacts ✘ Distribution of easy and difficult contacts ✘ Customers’ communication abilities ✽✽✽ Several mathematical realities are also at work. As discussed in Chapter 9, at a given service level, small groups are less efficient (have a lower occupancy) than larger groups. Because the number of contacts is changing throughout the day, so are the average contacts handled for a group or individuals within a group. Further, as discussed in Chapter 9, when service level goes up, occupancy and contacts handled go down."
  },
  {
    "page": 261,
    "paragraph": "To get around the fairness problem that occupancy creates, some managers convert raw contacts handled into normalized contacts handled (sometimes called “true contacts handled”), by dividing contacts handled by percent occupancy. Using the numbers in the table, 5.6 average contacts per agent divided by 65 percent occupancy (first row) is 8.6 normalized contacts. (The same is true for 6.7 contacts divided by 78 percent, 7.7 contacts divided by 90 percent, and 8.1 contacts divided by 94 percent.) This is really just another representation of average handling time (1800 seconds in a half hour divided by 210 seconds average handling time is also 8.6). As an alternative, others use statistical control charts to determine whether the process is in control, what it’s producing, and which agents, if any, are outside of statistical control. But even with these efforts, “true contacts handled” loses meaning with the variability of new contact channels, skills-based routing, and other capabilities that result in increasingly sophisticated and varied types of interactions. For managers who depended on contacts handled as a performance measure, this left a vacuum. Enter the two things that truly matter: being in the right place at the right time (adherence to schedule), and doing the right things (quality). Adherence to Schedule Adherence to schedule is a measure of…I guess this one’s pretty obvious…how well agents adhere to the schedule. Many, myself included, don’t particularly care for the tone of the term. And I don’t like the “big brother” interpretation I sometimes see in contact centers (which usually backfires). But the reality is, we’re in time-driven environments. So are stagehands. And astronauts. It doesn’t matter if we have the most incredible knowledge and expertise, if we’re not there when we’re needed. Adherence is a measure of how much time during an agent’s shift he or she is handling contacts or is available to handle contacts. If adherence is expected to be 90 percent, each agent should be handling or available to handle contacts .90 × 60 minutes, or 54 minutes per scheduled hour (on average). We’re in time-driven environments … It doesn’t matter if we have the most incredible knowledge and expertise, if we’re not there when we’re needed."
  },
  {
    "page": 262,
    "paragraph": "Adherence is based on the time, during an agent’s scheduled shift, that is spent in talk time, after-call work, waiting for contacts to arrive, and anything else (e.g., talking to someone in another department) associated with the contacts themselves. Lunch, breaks, training, work on assigned projects and other activities are factored out of the calculation, as the agent is not expected to be handling (or be available to handle) contacts during those times. (Note: be sure to differentiate the terms “adherence to schedule” and “agent occupancy.” They are two different things. In fact, when adherence to schedule goes up, service level will go up, which drives occupancy down. See Chapter 9.) Adherence can also incorporate the issue of timing—when was a person available to handle contacts? This is often called “schedule compliance.” The idea is to ensure that agents are available to handle contacts when needed. (In a time-sensitive environment, staying an extra 15 minutes at the end of a shift doesn’t make up for not being there at the beginning of the shift when workload was high.) Adherence to schedule should be established at levels that are reasonable and that reflect the many things that legitimately keep agents from handling contacts. It should also be flexible (e.g., adjustable downward) when the workload is light. How you approach this topic with agents can make a big difference. I once worked with a large healthcare organization that set up a resource center that patients could contact 24/7 for advice. At first, the manager got pushback from the employees—nurses and doctors—for establishing schedules, right down to break times. “What is this?” they asked. But as they discussed schedules in a planning meeting, one of the nurses reminded her colleagues that timing was something they were very good at. Every day, they were making time-driven decisions in operating rooms and on hospital floors. I saw heads nodding. They realized that this concept of adherence isn’t so different from what they were all used to, and they now have some of the most effective customer service I’ve seen. Agents cannot control how many contacts are coming in, how challenging customers might be, whether marketing gave the contact center a heads-up on their activities, and so on. But they can be in the right place at the right times. Coupled with good resource plans, that’s huge. Quality Enter quality. When well-defined (as they are in all successful contact centers), quality standards and processes dictate, in large part, the amount of time it will take to handle contacts in the manner they should be handled. These standards and processes provide the essential parameters to keep contact-handling as focused (as efficient and effective) as possible (without rushing, of course). Adherence and quality make a powerful pair. When in place, other measures—average handling time, number of contacts handled, percentage of time spent in talk or after-call work, and others—take ca"

    "paragraph": "Establishing adherence to schedule and quality as primary areas of focus enables agents to concentrate on the two things they can control: being in the right place at the right times and doing the right things. Note the consistency between individual objectives and the two themes that run throughout contact center management, beginning with the definition introduced in Chapter 1: service level and quality. Of course, focusing on adherence and quality is not feasible if your standards and metrics are vague. They must be implemented fairly, and with foresight and care. With that in mind, let’s look at each in more detail. ✽✽✽ UNDERSTANDING AVERAGE HANDLING TIME I once worked with a technical support center that had a fairly wide range of average handling times (AHTs). Most of the agents had AHTs somewhere from 8 to 12 minutes, but the AHT for one agent in the group was over 20 minutes. Their VP of customer service rightly questioned the range of AHTs (and the very long “outlier”) and wondered, “Is our service as efficient and consistent as it should be?” As I wandered around, I noticed that the agent with the long AHT had notes from customers taped to his wall, each thanking him for the great service he provided. Simply forcing a standard—say, to keep AHT to 12 minutes or less—could have caused any number of problems. The agent might have become disgruntled and quit. He might have stayed, but with the demoralizing view that the company really didn’t care about good service. The VP took an approach that turned out to be very wise. She had several agents, including the one with the particularly long AHT, create a flowchart of a typical customer support interaction. She gathered them in a room with a large conference table and gave them index cards and markers. “Work together to write each step you go through on a card and lay them out in order,” she explained. She returned a couple of hours later to find cards neatly laid out from one end of the table to the other. There were also some cards (steps) that diverged from the main flow. “What did you learn?” the VP asked. One employee volunteered that he wasn’t going through some of the same verification steps as others, and wondered whether that could lead to errors. The agent with the long AHT was walking customers through features he felt could be valuable to them. He admitted that he was probably going beyond tech support to provide training. But maybe that’s what they all should be doing? It was a fair question. As a team, they were now empowered with the insight necessary to intelligently discuss how far technical support should take things. I returned a few months later to find much more consistent services, handling times in a tighter range (10 to 12 minutes, including the agent in question), and employees that were as engaged as ever. In fact, some were involved with cross- functional efforts to assist with product development and customer training resources. Some leaders attempt to force chang"

When agents were available during their shift. Alternative terms include “schedule compliance” or “adherence.” Most centers that have established objectives on adherence to schedule track the amount of time agents are available. Many also incorporate the issue of timing. There’s certainly latitude for using different variables and for factoring out activities that are not subject to adherence. Establishing and putting your approach into place should be a team effort that includes agents (after all, they are the ones who will be assessed by it). Average adherence should be determined individually and for each agent group. Sometimes, individuals need specific coaching or training that is not necessary for the whole group. And tracking adherence as an average for the group reveals how well management is doing in creating an environment in which objectives can be achieved. At a tactical level, adherence monitoring works best as informational tools for agents and for team leaders who need to have a good perspective on what’s happening within their groups. The alternative is strict mandates, which puts supervisors in the role of “adherence police.” Ensure your approach is supporting the culture you want to establish. Here are some suggestions for getting the best results: ▪ Educate each person on how much impact he or she has on the queue and the associated importance of adherence to schedule (see discussion on the power of one, Chapter 9). ▪ Establish concrete service level and response time objectives that everybody knows and understands (see Chapter 4). ▪ Educate agents on the basic steps involved in resource planning so that they understand how schedules are produced and where they come from. ▪ Develop appropriate priorities for the wide range of tasks that your agents handle, and guidelines for how to respond to real-time changes in conditions. ▪ Provide real-time service level information to agents, but be sure to back it up with training on how to interpret it and how to respond at the team and individual levels (see Chapter 11). ▪ Manage schedule adherence as “locally” as possible (e.g., by individuals themselves and within their supervisory teams). ▪ Adherence results and trends for agent groups and the contact center itself are valuable for planning and to assess how well the management approach and supporting processes are working. In summary, adherence to schedule is an important objective. But apply it carefully, get involvement from the ground up, and back it up with the right education on why timing matters so much."

    "paragraph": "Quality Observation and Coaching Quality observation and coaching go hand in hand. Observation is a process that evaluates the qualitative aspects of handling customer interactions. Coaching, through one-on-one discussions, encourages employees to continue positive behavior and provides constructive feedback and guidance on areas of improvement. A well-designed, well-managed quality program will help in many ways; it: ▪ Provides insight into improving customer experience ▪ Identifies process improvements and work-reduction opportunities ▪ Measures the quality of interactions and the accuracy of information provided ▪ Gauges the effectiveness of and adherence to processes ▪ Provides data for trend analysis—to look for patterns of effectiveness across contact types, teams and centers ▪ Supports coaching by providing specific information that can be used for feedback ▪ Identifies additional training needs for individual agents ▪ Evaluates the effectiveness of training ▪ Identifies customer needs and expectations ▪ Helps assess customer satisfaction ▪ Contributes to hiring and training by highlighting needed skills and competencies ▪ Ensures legal compliance and reduces the risk of liability ▪ Ensures the organization’s policies are followed and produces insights on how they can be improved With so much at stake, it’s important to design an effective approach and establish supporting quality standards that you can confidently use to set a baseline and assess progress. Here’s a summary of the most important steps in developing a quality observation and coaching program: ▪ When developing or revamping a quality program, create a cross-functional project team that ensures those who will be most impacted by the program have a part in creating it. ▪ Identify your goals and objectives for the program, which often include agent improvement, consistency, process improvement, identifying training needs, and providing the basis for coaching."

Standards of performance by key contact element (e.g., recognizing needs, thoroughness, accuracy, customer service skills) will need to be defined. ▪ Develop an ongoing calibration process, which helps ensure that supervisors, quality analysts and coaches evaluate interactions and approach coaching consistently and fairly. ▪ Develop an approach for coaching, which involves deciding who will have responsibility for coaching activities (generally, the individual who observes the interaction provides coaching and feedback), identifying standards for coaching, and anticipating when coaching will happen and how it will be scheduled. ▪ Communicate program details to agents, informing them of the purpose of observation, how it will be conducted, and how results will be used. It’s also important to provide them with written quality observation policies, the criteria on which they will be evaluated, and applicable forms and scorecards. ✽✽✽ ALTERNATIVES FOR ASSESSING QUALITY There are a number of alternatives for assessing the quality of interactions. The most common include: ▪ Customer input ▪ Direct observation ▪ Role-play ▪ Recorded interactions ▪ Analytics (with recorded interactions) ▪ Mystery shoppers Today, there are many solutions that enable you to survey customers through the channels that make the most sense. It’s notable how high the response rates can be for transaction-specific surveys that are short, easy and immediately follow an interaction. And with automated surveys, you can get a large sample that can be tied to agents or customer demographics (such as VIPs) or other criteria. Personalized surveys can boost response rates even more. For example, the agent’s name and picture can be included with the question, how did Brad do? A second question can be more process-oriented; for example, was your issue resolved? Or, how"

    "paragraph": "likely is it that you’ll recommend our service? Employees tend to like getting feedback directly from customers. There will, at times, be negative feedback that has nothing to do with the agent—it’s product-, process- or policy-related, and you’ll need to keep that in mind when interpreting results. A pervasive challenge in customer surveys is that response rates tend to drop as you ask for additional input. So there’s often a limit to how much information you can get on specific aspects of quality. That’s where internal observations are so valuable. Samples of five to ten interactions per agent per month are common in many organizations. ✽✽✽ Standards and Scoring The cornerstone of an effective quality observation process is documenting specific, observable behaviors and tailoring coaching accordingly. There are many types of forms and evaluation methods, and many possible scoring methods. An effective way to consider performance (quality) standards is to categorize them as either “foundation” or “finesse.” Foundation standards measure whether something was done, and can be assessed with a simple yes or no. For example, the agent uses their name in the greeting. They verify the customer’s identification. They use spellcheck in written communication. They code the contact correctly. Yes or no—these things either happened or they didn’t. Foundation standards are objective, consistent, and accomplished the same way by every agent. They are, as a rule, easy to understand and easy to score. Finesse standards, on the other hand, measure how something was done. They are more subjective, allow for style and individuality, and require interpretation. For example, the agent listens carefully and effectively prompts relevant input. They demonstrate professional courtesy. They upsell or cross-sell appropriately. They guide the customer to convenient online resources. They capture needed and useful information for product, process, or service improvements. These standards require clear guidance on what is expected, but performance is along a continuum. Accordingly, common scoring approaches can be categorized as either yes/no or as a numerical range. The yes/no approach (alternately denoted by 1/0) best fits foundation standards. Overall results for foundation standards related to an interaction may be expressed by the number of yeses and noes (9 Y and 1 N), a fraction (9/10) or a percentage (90%). Numerical scoring generally presents a range of possibilities (e.g., 1 to 3), which scorers can use to rate finesse standards (the agent’s proficiency in applying the skill). The wider variety of scores possible with a numerical scoring method reveals subtle skill improvements; for example, an employee may have some competence in a skill but not yet achieved full mastery. Foundation and Finesse Criteria"

You might choose to indicate N/A (or “exempt”) specific skills during certain types of calls (where N/As are either counted as yeses or another agreed-upon score, or are not counted at all).

You might even move away from scores"

    "paragraph": "altogether. When looking at the sample quality criteria, remember that the forms and standards you use should reflect your organization’s unique mission and brand. And criteria should be backed up by descriptions, training, coaching, and ongoing calibration sessions—this will ensure all involved understand expectations and can deliver the essential components of service consistently. In short, your approach should fit your needs. Before you implement a scoring system, consider the following recommendations, which come from ICMI’s quality observation and coaching courses: ▪ The scoring system should be easy to use and easy to explain. ▪ The scoring system should emphasize the award of points for positively demonstrated skills, rather than deductions for negative behaviors. ▪ Managers, supervisors, and agents should thoroughly understand how the scoring system works. ▪ Advise management and agents to keep scores in context. Specific feedback and coaching is the most essential part of the observation and coaching process and is what ultimately improves quality. Don’t overemphasize scores. ▪ Resist the temptation to coach to scores. Scores don’t improve the quality of an interaction; specific feedback and coaching to behaviors do. Some contact centers do not share scores with agents until after the coaching session. ▪ The scoring system should directly reflect contact center objectives, objectives for interactions, and the behaviors you want to encourage. A flawed system may underemphasize critical behaviors and overemphasize non-essential skills. ▪ Confirm the mathematical validity of the scoring system, especially if a total score is compiled or the system is weighted. ▪ Establish the validity of the system by testing it before it can have an impact on individuals (e.g., before scores are included as part of performance-based pay). ▪ Understand that agents become very interested in scoring systems if they are tied to bonuses, performance evaluations and salary reviews. Be prepared to handle their questions and concerns. ▪ When possible, define variations in specific behaviors associated with a skill and the corresponding scores (e.g., what behaviors earn a 1 or a 3 or a 5?). ✽✽✽"

What’s not so common, but becoming trendier, is dropping the score from those scorecards. That’s what the Navy Federal Credit Union (NFCU) contact center decided to do. With more than seven million members and a contact center of more than four thousand team members, NFCU has many opportunities to receive feedback. As Quality Service Manager Kristy Powers explains, “Our Quality Service team wants the same thing for our employees that we want for our members—for them to have a meaningful, personalized experience. With that in mind, our Quality Service group embarked on an initiative to transition all teams in the contact center away from a 23-section checklist with multiple forms, to the new one-page, scoreless, behavioral-based model.” NFCU’s Quality Partners review five interactions and complete one feedback form per month, per agent, with a focus on behaviors in four key areas: ▪ Highlights—things that were great ▪ Opportunities—areas for improvement, along with tips ▪ Areas of focus—priorities to focus on right away ▪ Resources—links to internal and external resources that can help the agent gain skills Agents now focus on the content of the feedback, versus things that must happen to earn “points.” The result? Improved quality and higher employee and member satisfaction. (And the icing on the cake was an ICMI Global Contact Center Awards trophy for Best QA/Customer Experience.) Kristy says, “Everything we do, every single day, is done with the goal of providing effortless experiences and wow-worthy service. Our member experience scores are one of our primary benchmarks of success. We view our QA process as a vital tool to evaluate where we’re doing well and identify any opportunities for improvement that can help us achieve an ever-higher level of member satisfaction.” Source: “Want to Improve Quality? Ditch the Score from Your Scorecards,” by Erica Marois, ICMI Contact Center Insider newsletter ✽✽✽ Calibration In contact centers, calibration is the process that ensures variations in interpreting performance results are minimized. When high levels of calibration are achieved, it doesn’t matter who does the assessment and scoring, or who facilitates coaching—the approach and the outcome will be the same. Calibration is an important tool for ensuring consistency in interpreting performance. It also makes coaching much easier. It allows the coaching process to focus on achievements and improvement opportunities rather than agents’ concerns about whether scores are accurate or fair. There are four levels of successful calibration: ▪ Overall agreement on the interaction"

  {
    "page": 271,
    "paragraph": "▪ Ratings are consistent for each quality standard ▪ Coaching is calibrated—there’s agreement on what to coach ▪ Internal ratings are calibrated with customer input A common way to begin calibration is to have those who do quality evaluations independently score several of the same interactions. In contact centers, these are usually recorded interactions. If you do not have recorded interactions, you can use alternatives such as role-play scenarios or observations. You then compare the results. First, check for overall agreement on how interactions went (the first level of calibration). You can then compare scores for specific quality criteria (the second level of calibration). If, at this point, there is disagreement—if scores vary—you’ll need to discuss interpretation. If that doesn’t get you there, you’ll need to revamp the standards or descriptions of them until you reach consistent interpretation. The third level of calibration, and one fewer organizations achieve, is in the consistency and effectiveness of coaching. Research shows that employees want to know what’s expected of their performance, where they stand, and how they can improve. This spans all generations, including those just entering the workforce. But if completely different conversations take place, efforts to improve quality begin to break down. An often-overlooked or under-utilized benefit of calibration is that it improves the skills of coaches. This outcome requires that a skilled facilitator (ideally, a “consummate coach”) leads the calibration. Once the team agrees on an overall score for an interaction, the facilitator should work with the team to gain agreement on what should be coached—specifically, which performance standards were well-demonstrated and which need to be improved. It’s helpful to then role-play what the coaching conversation might sound like. Calibrated coaching can also provide powerful insight into hiring and training practices. For example, what are the skills, knowledge, and behaviors you’re looking for in job candidates, and how can you best focus training on ensuring your team is prepared? The fourth level of calibration is to compare internal assessments with customer input. Do these metrics align? Are you and your customers on the same page about what’s important? Few organizations achieve 100% alignment of internal and external scores. But scores should be directionally the same. You want to ensure that your priorities reflect those of your customers. My recommendation: calibration should be an ongoing activity. The most effective organizations have working calibration sessions at least quarterly. In addition to ensuring consistency and fairness, these organizations use calibration sessions to look for quality trends and prioritize improvements. ✽✽✽"

    "paragraph": "BLUE-RIBBON QUALITY AT DELTA DENTAL Supervisors often ask, “How do we get agents to embrace the feedback given during coaching sessions?” Delta Dental of Michigan, an affiliate of the largest dental plan system in the United States, implemented a color rating system as part of quality observation and coaching. Blue is awarded for superior demonstration of a skill or for going above and beyond for a member—it is like earning a blue ribbon. Green, yellow and red round out the scoring colors. Ideally, the scorecard for an agent is mostly green and blue. When yellow or red crops up in a consistent pattern, it is quickly identified so the agent and the supervisor can work together to build the needed knowledge or skill. In ongoing town hall meetings, agents listen to a recorded call. Asked to provide an overall reaction, attendees raise the colored flag of their choice. Several are given the opportunity to share why they chose the color they did and what, in their opinion, could have been done differently to make the contact deserve a “blue ribbon.” There is active participation during these sessions and agents challenge each other to raise the bar. Carmen Schmuecker, Director of Command Center, shares, “Agents who once disliked listening to their calls now look forward to the feedback from their coaches. They can look at quality scorecards and immediately identify areas of opportunity.” The quality of interactions has gone from “strong to fabulous.” By Laura Grimes, Senior Certified Business Associate, ICMI ✽✽✽ Coaching When effective, coaching is something your agents will want and will look forward to. (Yes, it is possible!) And in the most-engaged teams I’ve seen, there are five essential ingredients. First, coaching is a relationship, NOT an event. The best coaches build relationships of trust, respect, and accountability. They help clarify goals, serve as role models, and provide positive reinforcement. Second, coaching has far more impact when it’s supported by clear quality standards. Your standards should be understood and interpreted consistently. And this works in both directions; quality standards guide coaching, and coaching, in turn, helps your employees consistently deliver services that reflect your standards. Third, all of your coaches should use a proven coaching model. There are many to choose from. As one example, ICMI recommends a simple framework that can be remembered by the letters SAFE: ▪ Summarize observed behavior in the context of quality standards. ▪ Ask the employee for their input on how things went. ▪ Formulate a plan with them for addressing performance gaps and opportunities. ▪ Express thanks for their time and input."

    "paragraph": "There’s the risk that any approach can be formulaic, so your coaches will want to convey these things with their own style and personality. But whether you use this model or another, it’s essential that there’s agreement on what will be coached. Fourth, effective coaching focuses on the toughest and most important challenges. For example: ▪ What does it mean to really listen and understand customers? ▪ How do you find the best solutions for customer issues? ▪ How can you turn around tough customers or successfully handle particularly complex issues? Organizations that do a great job with these challenges create scenarios and role plays. You won’t be able to anticipate or train on every unique issue that comes along, so your employees will need to know how to make good decisions. That takes practice. Finally, approach training, coaching, and performance standards as opportunities to empower your agents to coach themselves. Self-coaching is the talk each person has with himself or herself as service is delivered day by day and moment by moment. For self-coaching to be effective, each person should have a deep understanding of the organization’s mission, values, and quality standards. They must also be empowered to make good, in-the-moment decisions (see Chapter 11). How effective is coaching in your organization? I encourage you to check it against these five traits. Getting the Most from Your Quality Program Chances are your contact center has made significant investments in quality observation. You probably have spent hundreds of combined hours and tens of thousands of dollars developing criteria, investigating legal requirements, and orienting agents and supervisors to the program. And it’s likely that quality observation and related coaching activities take more combined time than any other activity except handling the customer workload. But are you getting the results you should from your quality program? As discussed in the previous chapter, there’s far more to handling customer contacts than improving the satisfaction of those customers, as important as that is. As a primary customer touchpoint, the contact center has significant potential to provide other business units with valuable intelligence and insight. Organizations that get the most leverage out of these efforts share some common characteristics: THEY ALIGN QUALITY OBSERVATION WITH KEY BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. There’s a common understanding within the organization that the contact center has a larger mission than just handling customer interactions. So it makes sense that effective quality programs—whether they employ low-tech listening, recordings or high-tech analytics—are designed to do much more than assist with individual training and development. They also focus on leveraging the knowledge gathered from contacts into better systems, processes and services"

    "paragraph": "across the organization. In short, the most effective centers identify issues that are beyond the center’s scope but still need to be addressed or fixed. THEY INCORPORATE QUALITY CRITERIA THAT SUPPORT BROAD IMPROVEMENTS. These include capturing needed and useful information, detecting and documenting unsolicited marketplace feedback, assessing whether contacts could have been prevented, and encouraging (and sharing) customer insight that helps design better products and services. (The organizations recognize that accomplishing these objectives is not within the direct control of those handling interactions, but must be identified at the point of contact.) THEY CORRELATE QUALITY OBSERVATIONS WITH OTHER KEY RESULTS. For example, they compare how quality observation results compare to customer satisfaction, customer sentiment in social media channels, employee satisfaction, service levels, revenues, and costs. Are there correlations, and how strong are they? Better understanding how the organization’s mission is related to contact center activities and results will lead to significant improvements and innovations. THEY REGULARLY CALIBRATE FOR FAIRNESS AND CONSISTENCY. Does your quality program reflect what is really happening in a consistent and unbiased way? To find out, conduct a simple experiment. Have those who do the evaluations independently score five to ten recorded interactions. Then compare the results. If the scores are significantly different, take the system back to the shop for a tune-up or complete overhaul. Until you do, you’ll be getting mixed results and wasting time and effort. Or worse, you’ll be alienating agents who don’t trust the results and who aren’t getting the recognition or help they need. THEY ACTIVELY SUPPORT TRAINING. Elaine Carr, who is a group instructional design manager at ICMI, cautions, “We see again and again where people show up for training with no idea what the training is about or why they are attending. This sometimes leads to resentment that they even have to attend training. On the other hand, if your manager tells you about the training and the two of you set some learning goals, you’re going to be pretty motivated.” THEY INVOLVE AGENTS IN ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. It’s become a recognized (and true!) tenet of the quality movement that those closest to the work know and understand it best. Your agents are in an ideal position to help define what constitutes a quality experience for customers, and how processes, training, systems, and interdepartmental coordination can be improved. Agent involvement also encourages ownership and engagement, and it improves agents’ job satisfaction. The Complementary Roles of Hiring, Training, and Coaching As is often pointed out, the best contact centers do a great job of hiring, training, and coaching. But the point that is sometimes understated is the degree to which these processes depend on and benefit each other. Consider hiring. An effective recruiting and hiring proce"

With it, you’ll be assembling a team that (with the right training and support) can work together effectively, support and further the organization’s culture, and adapt and change as the customer contact environment evolves. Some underlying trends have resulted in training becoming increasingly important. One is that the environment is becoming more complex, requiring robust training that provides a strong and effective knowledge base for agents. A more subtle trend is that many managers are placing greater emphasis on finding agents who support and further the culture of the organization and then training them on appropriate skills, rather than finding those with the right skills but who may not fit as well culturally. Effective coaching is an in-the-trenches, hands-on activity, directly focused on specific problems, solutions, and opportunities. In coaching, there’s no hiding from the issues or glossing over the details. Coaching provides valuable insight into the hiring process by helping identify the traits of agents who perform best. And it must be a primary feeder of training—identifying performance gaps, improvement opportunities, practical lessons learned, and other issues that are leveraged when they are addressed at the group level. In short, hiring, training and coaching are interrelated aspects of an overall effort. They work best when they are viewed and managed as essential parts of a cohesive whole. ✽✽✽ BOOSTING TRAINING ROI There are countless potential benefits from training—increased performance, improved motivation, higher customer and employee satisfaction, and increased organization success, to name a few. “Potential” is the key word, because some critical ingredients are necessary. Training has the best chance of success, and will deliver the highest ROI, when: ▪ Training is, in fact, the right solution for the situation. Training can’t “fix” people who are fundamentally wrong for the job. ▪ The reason for training has been communicated to the target audience. Do participants know what the training is about and why they are there? ▪ You’ve done some pre-planning. It’s powerful to have agents come to training with a checklist or summary of goals, especially when they had a part in creating it around an understood and shared set of objectives. ▪ You reinforce training after it happens. Training can facilitate learning new skills and knowledge, but it won’t stick without practice and reinforcement. ▪ You deliver refresher training as needed. (Example: training new agents on adherence and other performance metrics is great, but they will need one or more refreshers as they settle in.) ▪ Training is relevant to the job, the center, the customer and the organization. ▪ The trainer/facilitator understands the goals and objectives for the training, as well as the target audience. ▪ The training delivery method matches the need; the method (e.g., form"

By Rose Polchin, Senior Consultant, ICMI ✽✽✽ Assessing Performance for Other Job Roles What about assessing performance for those in other positions, such as analysts, trainers, and managers? How does the reality of overlapping responsibilities (discussed in Chapter 12) translate into performance standards for individuals and teams? Every person has a direct impact on contact center performance objectives. But is it fair to set performance standards on things that are outside the direct control of an individual? In principle—and in practice—the answers are fairly simple. Managers, by definition, are responsible for achieving results through other people. Consequently, senior-level managers and directors are generally held responsible for the full set of performance objectives that the organization establishes. Of course, they shouldn’t be held accountable for objectives that are in conflict or that are mutually exclusive. And they can only accomplish what is possible within the context of the resources they have to work with. But, in general, they answer for overall results. Managers and analysts in supporting roles are in a similar situation. However, more specific responsibilities and accountabilities are associated with their primary areas of authority. For example, the workforce manager in charge of forecasting and scheduling is accountable for the accuracy of the forecast even though it is influenced by many variables, people, and departments outside of his or her immediate control. Given overlapping responsibilities, successful centers work hard to educate everyone on the interrelated nature of processes and the impact each person has on results, while still establishing key areas of accountability. As you establish accountabilities, keep your eye on the big picture. What is the contact center’s mission? Which activities best support that mission? How can you best align expectations to drive the right activities and, in turn, further your mission and strategy?

Excessive turnover has many negative implications for an organization: higher recruiting and training costs; a lower average experience level leading to higher handling times, more transferred contacts, and lower service levels/response times; the need for more coaching and supervision; and the impact on everyone’s morale when key people leave. But some types of turnover can also bring benefits. Take internal agent attrition, for example. If employees leave for other positions within the organization, the contact center will have experienced advocates in other departments. And turnover can create the means for the center to bring in additional employees with needed skills and fresh insights. The causes and costs/benefits will vary by type of turnover. For example, voluntary external turnover is more of a detriment to the organization than planned internal turnover. For better or worse, turnover will have an impact on your center.

Problems are often by-products of a poor planning process, so they assess and address resource issues. These contact centers are also broadening the responsibilities that agents have and their opportunities to learn, grow and advance (see discussion on career paths, Chapter 16). One powerful tool in improving retention and deepening employee engagement is the “stay interview.” Dick Finnegan, author of The Power of Stay Interviews for Engagement and Retention, describes a stay interview as “a structured discussion a leader conducts with each individual employee to learn the specific actions she must take to strengthen that employee’s engagement and retention with the organization.” I’ve found stay interviews to be informative and inspiring—and they underscore a key principle: retention is an important leadership responsibility. I’ve noticed a shift in perspective on internal turnover (people leaving the contact center for other opportunities within the organization). In many ways, it’s a good thing. The time people spend on the front lines with customers gives them a healthy perspective that they carry into other departments. But there has to be a balance. Losing people too soon can cost the contact center, and the organization, dearly. Consequently, a growing number of contact center managers are working to lengthen the time agents spend in the center before moving elsewhere in the organization. As part of that, they are helping agents see the enormous impact the center can have on the organization and customer base, as well as the exciting future ahead as communications change and trends such as social"

Go back with me— for just a moment—to how we got here. Let’s start in 1858, 15 years after Samuel B. Morse introduced the telegraph (Chapter 1). After more than a year of enduring storms, sickness and failures on the high seas, the crew of HMS Agamemnon completed running the first transatlantic telegraph cable. Investors on both sides of the Atlantic had provided the funding, and hopes for the beginnings of a new communications era were high. Unfortunately, the signals that trickled through the cable were so weak that it took over 16 hours and the most sensitive equipment available to decipher the first message (which, incidentally, was 90 words sent by Queen Victoria). Worse, the cable’s insulation failed several days later, and the telegraph never worked again. For onlookers, investors, and especially the crew, this was a heartbreaking and bitter end to an immense and bold undertaking. But the project—though viewed as a failure at the time—helped to establish a vision of a more connected world. “A plate of silver and one of zinc are taken into the mouth, the one above, the other below the tongue. They are then placed in contact with the wire, and words issuing from the mouth are conveyed by the wire.” 1854 NEWSPAPER, DESCRIBING HOW THE YET-TO-BE-INVENTED TELEPHONE MIGHT WORK It wasn’t until almost a century later, in 1956, that the first transatlantic telephone cable was inaugurated, running between the British Isles and Newfoundland, Canada. The crew and investors of 1858 would be amazed to see what has transpired since. High-capacity fiber optic cables crisscross oceans and continents, and satellite transmissions reach homes and businesses in the most remote parts of the globe. With more than five billion subscriptions, mobile services provide connectivity virtually everywhere. As I write, I’m in San Diego—but could just as easily be in Seoul, São Paulo, or Southampton.

A key part of the equation is the way information and services are digitally represented and transported. Consider a familiar example: digital photography. You can snap a picture on your smartphone, post it to Instagram, text a link to Grandma, and use it as the home screen image on your phone. Similarly, music can be downloaded, edited, transferred to a portable player, used as the ringtone on your mobile device, and easily played through your car or the speakers you bring to the beach. Pictures, music, calls, messaging, video, television, movies, games (you name it) have been forever freed from the rigid technical confines of the past. Everything is digital—let’s call that phase two. If it’s all digital, any of these media can be integrated to create new services. Let’s call Grandma—by video of course—and show her San Diego’s Old Town, the park we’re visiting. In fact, let’s set a few pictures and video clips to music (Mariachi would be perfect) and share it with the rest of the family…it will just take a moment. We can refer to the integration of digital media with other services as phase three. Oh, and about San Diego, someone mentioned a fascinating documentary that contrasts the different cultures of the region. The gift shop features a collector’s set on Blu-ray … or, wait, I’ll go online and we can stream it to any device. And on the topic of online, it’s nice to know these priceless pictures are being backed up automatically. We can refer to these capabilities as phase four: cloud-based or hosted services. Speaking of cloud, it’s getting cloudy—should we expect showers? Let me ask Siri…Good, it’s clearing and will be a perfect 76° this afternoon.

As the world became connected, contact centers began to spring up out of the customer expectation for services “on demand.” Let’s start at the birth of the “modern” contact center.

Toll-free “800 service” was introduced in 1967 and the automatic call distributor (ACD)—now more accurately"

Those advancements provided the basic capabilities contact centers still very much depend on: identify, route and distribute customer contacts to a pool of cross-trained agents. In short, make connections between customers and someone who can help. Integrated voice and data first became possible through “computer telephony integration” (CTI), introduced in the late 1980s. CTI enabled screen pops (simultaneous voice and data delivery), database-driven call-routing, integrated performance reporting, and a host of other capabilities. But CTI was transitional, an attempt to bring together what were still two separate worlds: voice and data. And it was expensive and required a significant amount of programming, making it impractical to implement for many contact centers. The migration of traditional circuit-switching based on time-division multiplexing (TDM) to packet-switching based on Internet protocol (IP) brought fundamental change to contact centers. What were essentially two sets of technologies—one for voice, one for data—became part of the same platform of services. That opened up all kinds of new capabilities. IP-enabled services also helped usher in the next phase of development: hosted or cloud- based services. (Contact centers use a number of terms to describe these services, including cloud-based contact center, hosted contact center, virtual contact center, and contact center as a service or CCaaS.) Virtually any capability available in premise-based (on site) equipment and software can be “rented” and delivered through the cloud, leaving much of the development and many of the maintenance activities to the supplier. The benefits of today’s IP- and cloud-based technologies are significant, including: ▪ OMNICHANNEL. All channels (e.g., voice, chat, text, video, social media) can be integrated and handled by a common routing and reporting system. True omnichannel enables the customer and agent to move from one channel to the next, with reports maintaining a holistic view of the experience. ▪ VIRTUAL. Anyone who is part of the organization’s network—including agents working from home, and colleagues in other departments or across the globe—can be part of the contact center, whether routinely or on an as-needed basis. ▪ SCALABLE. Adding or reducing agents is (compared with the past) simple and cost- effective, with minimal technology impact. ▪ SIMPLIFIED MANAGEMENT. Moving to IP architecture can result in fewer, more tightly integrated systems that are far easier to manage than separate systems. ▪ INTEGRATED REPORTS. With activities consolidated within one architecture, reports can provide a more holistic perspective of contacts and customers across sites and channels. ▪ DISASTER BACKUP. If set up correctly, IP-based architecture and cloud-based services provide “redundancy” (backup) to ensure business continuity in the case of a natural (or other) disaster."

    "paragraph": "▪ OPEN STANDARDS. Systems based on open, common standards enable new applications to be integrated more easily. ▪ COST-EFFECTIVE. All things being equal, the costs to purchase, use and maintain IP- based systems are often lower than for the separate systems of the past. In short, today’s IP- and cloud-based services have opened up opportunity for organizations of virtually any size to build contact centers that are feature-rich, scalable, and cost-effective. When you think about capabilities that were once available to only the largest organizations now being accessible to a five- or ten-person contact center—wow, the competitive implications are very interesting! Now, this all sounds pretty rosy, right? You may be thinking, “Great, but our organization is not ‘there’ yet.” I get it. Many organizations aren’t there yet. For all the advantages of IP- and cloud-based capabilities, and for all the benefits that AI is beginning to deliver, many organizations still have a somewhat disjointed combination of new and old systems. I can think of several I’m working with who are, right now, in the middle of significant digital transformation initiatives, with one of the goals being to transition away from “legacy” (old) systems they’ve had for many years. This is not an all-at-once leap for most. The truth is that changing systems is costly, with expenses going far beyond the systems themselves to data migration, compatibility issues, training, and the like. What you have may be working just fine for now. You and your team will need to take a good look at your current capabilities, what you require and how you’ll get there. You’ll need a technology roadmap. Let’s look at developments in specific areas. Some will weigh heavily into your priorities. Routing: Getting the Right Contacts to the Right Places The efficiencies contact centers can bring to an organization have always stemmed largely from how customer contacts are routed and distributed. Prior to call centers, the “clientele approach” was prevalent: customers tended to ask for and talk to the same representatives, whom they reached through a switchboard operator or by dialing a direct number. It was not very efficient. When ACDs arrived in the early 1970s, they challenged existing thinking. Rather than send calls to individuals, ACDs could automatically connect calls to a group of “pooled” agents who were trained to handle a variety of customer issues. Shared computer systems and information also played important roles in this concept. In short, the \"powerful pooling principle\" became the core of contact center efficiency But the pooling principle is only powerful if agents are effectively cross-trained to handle the variety of contacts that come their way. Most organizations have more than one agent group— sometimes many—geared around specific types of interactions, channels, or areas of specialized expertise. (See discussion of agent groups, Chapters 9 and 16.) In the early days of ACDs, these ag"

Today, routing and distribution is far more flexible. Customer information, agent availability, workload conditions and many other parameters can be included in the criteria. Skills-based routing, which entered the market in the early 1990s, makes it possible to route individual contacts to specific agents (see Chapter 7). Analytics and AI-driven applications can also help get contacts to the right places. The “vision” (still a work in progress for many) is for one single routing application to handle all interactions and channels across the contact center’s operations. A single routing engine does not mean that you must use universal agents (“super agents”) to handle everything—that’s for you to decide. Instead, the criteria you define dictate how contacts are delivered and handled. The degree to which your center is “pooled” or “specialized” depends on the criteria you establish. ✽✽✽ Identifying Customers and What They Need To implement customized routing and contact-handling protocols, you’ll need to know who your customers are and what they need when they contact your organization (see Chapter 7). Common identification methods include: ▪ Customer-entered information (e.g., into an IVR, speech system, webpage or mobile app), which can be matched to services desired or specific customer records ▪ ANI (automatic number identification), the number the call originated from, which can often be matched to customer records in a database ▪ DNIS (dialed number identification services), the telephone number the customer dials, which can indicate the reason for the contact, language preference, etc. ▪ Email recipient address, subject line, sender’s address or customer-entered data, which can be matched to services desired or customer records ▪ Web address, social media name, or demographic information (e.g., location), which can be matched to services desired or customer records ▪ TTY (text telephone) capabilities, which enable your organization to receive, verify, route and handle contacts from customers who are hearing-impaired ▪ Analytics and AI-enabled bots, which can decipher voice- or text-based conversations to determine the best routing options (See GM Leverages AI in Social Customer Care.) ✽✽✽ Boosting Productivity and Quality"

    "paragraph": "In recent years, there have been many developments that can improve contact center performance. Again, the underlying themes include architecture based on open standards, ability to integrate with other systems, flexibility, and maximum user control. Examples include: WORKFORCE OPTIMIZATION SYSTEMS. At a basic level, workforce management systems (now generally referred to as workforce optimization systems) provide automated tools for forecasting, staff calculations, schedules, tracking and reporting. In recent years, applications have become increasingly good at handling these core processes. For example, forecasting and scheduling for the full range of contact channels, along with skills-based scheduling and user- defined reports that integrate with other systems, have supported the emerging omnichannel environment. Administration of these systems has become much easier, with far better integration with payroll and financial systems. Integration with quality observation systems and training tools has become robust, enabling seamless forecasting, scheduling, and real-time management of virtually any contact center activity (including activity not directly related to handling customer interactions). One of the most useful developments has been improvements in modules that enable what-if analysis for budgeting and resource decisions. And the real crowd-pleaser has been empowering agents to manage their own schedules. QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. At a basic level, quality management systems record interactions and enable review for quality improvement purposes. Many systems can be set up to record all interactions or a sampling of interactions. Both voice and screen (how the agent enters data) activities can be captured and, increasingly, all contact channels can be included. Integration with other systems can provide rich, three-dimensional reports on activities, help with coaching and training, and link to elearning modules that are geared around individual performance evaluations. Supervisors can insert voice annotations into original recordings for training purposes and managers can include specific contacts in reports delivered to senior management, colleagues in other departments, or others. But the benefits go far beyond those associated with recording and reviewing contacts. Analytics—speech and text—has been a hot trend in contact centers, and for good reason. Analytics can identify problem areas, trends, and customer sentiment. This insight enables the broader organization to improve products, services, and processes (see Lutron’s Insight Center, Chapter 13). CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP CAPABILITIES. There are many applications that can help you establish and build better relationships with customers. For example, contact management technologies enable you to log contacts, view customer profiles and access a consolidated history of all contacts customers have had with the organization, through any channel—face-to-face, phone, email, web, social"

They can also identify influencers—those who have the greatest impact on your reputation and brand, given the nature or quantity of their “followers.” Related applications prioritize and deliver relevant conversations to agents who can engage with customers where and when appropriate. This has been a game changer for many contact centers, enabling them to be directly involved in delivering effective service through social media channels. ANALYTICS AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT. Many organizations are realizing that their data is the proverbial gold mine, and are turning to increasingly sophisticated tools for its gathering, storage, analysis, and reporting. Analytics APIs can pull together, distill, and analyze information from many sources.

Document imaging and on-screen retrieval can boost first contact resolution. The ability to send real-time information on contact center performance to agent desktops helps them stay attuned to trends and developments. Auto-greetings allow agents to pre-record their introductions, so that every interaction is started with the right greeting delivered in a cheerful voice. (This also gives agents a valuable few seconds to read the information presented to them in preparation for the interaction.) Collaboration tools help agents—or anyone else across the organization—access information or subject matter experts in other areas. When managed with the right expectations and approach, these tools quickly become indispensable. Gamification applications, when used well, can provide focus and fun to help achieve important goals. Contact management features themselves provide increasingly customizable work states, contact coding options and contact handling capabilities (e.g., one-click transfers or requests for assistance). These capabilities can be provided on a telephone set or by “softphone” (a virtual phone) on the computer desktop. IVR AND SPEECH CAPABILITIES. When coupled with databases and routing systems, IVR systems enable customers to access (and provide) information through keypad input or speech recognition. Visual IVRs are now available for use with smartphones. Speech recognition has improved dramatically in recent years. By enabling a more natural interface, well-designed systems greatly extend application opportunities (it’s a lot easier to say “Puerto Vallarta, Mexico” than to enter it on a keypad). Speech engines and algorithms have become increasingly robust and are able to recognize accents, colloquialisms, and expansive vocabularies. Some organizations are using voice biometrics—speech identification technology —for secure and easy customer authentication. Post-contact surveys quickly and effectively gather information that can be tied to specific interactions and agents (see Chapter 14). And personalized applications can help deepen relationships and encourage the use of self-service options (when I call my preferred airline, I’m greeted with “Welcome back, Brad”). WEB-BASED AND MOBILE APPS. From the simple FAQs (frequently asked questions) that became common several decades ago to today’s powerful multimedia applications that enable everything from financial trading to real-time flight tracking, web-based and mobile apps have forever changed the way we live and work.

Some believe AI will largely take over contact centers, while others see it as an over-hyped sideshow to more important areas of focus. Dr. Raj Ramesh (a friend I met through the National Speaker’s Association) is one of the clearest voices I know on AI and machine learning. He’s author of AI and You, a book he originally wrote for his children so they would understand how AI will impact their opportunities and careers. (He also has some terrific YouTube videos, easy to find by searching his name.) The human brain is infinitely complex.

Rather than envisioning a robot taking over an agent’s role (which is very unlikely), think instead of the individual processes you’re handling: ▪ Determining the customer’s need ▪ Getting the customer to the right place ▪ Authenticating that it’s really them ▪ Retrieving required information ▪ Piecing together needed information ▪ Doing calculations and analysis ▪ Capturing data on the interaction"

    "paragraph": "▪ And so on You get the idea. It’s in specific aspects of delivering service—not taking the place of an agent—that AI is having (and will continue have) the biggest impact. Raj makes a bold prediction: “With this technology, every aspect of business and every business will be impacted.” But he reminds us that AI is light years away from doing things that humans can do. For example, he says that in the near future: ▪ AI will drive cars, but won’t be able to comfort your daughter after a romantic breakup. ▪ AI will find answers to customer questions, but won’t be able to empathize with a customer who just lost their house in a tornado. ▪ AI will crunch a lot of data to identify underlying patterns, but won’t be able to figure out what kind of data to crunch. AI is real and powerful, but many of the effective applications I’m seeing are not grabbing headlines. They are instead quietly and significantly improving operations, and agent/customer interactions. They are helping with what were laborious, manual, or piecemeal processes. And most are working in tandem with agents, enabling technology to do what it does best—and humans to do what we do best. Many AI applications will improve over time. For example, Delta Air Lines utilizes an AI- based virtual assistant as the starting point for conversations with customers, fielding simple queries and elevating more complex issues to agents. As Tori Forbes-Roberts, Vice President, Reservation Sales, Customer Care and Digital Engagement, put it in a PYMNTS.com post, the virtual assistant “does learn over time,” so the expectation is that it will begin to handle a broader range of conversations. Artificial Intelligence ≠ Artificial Wisdom I believe that in contact centers, AI will end up being a powerful assistant. It will free agents to become more responsive and engaging, to create rapport and make connections in the way only humans can. Artificial intelligence is not artificial wisdom. It’s my hope that finance and technology leaders won’t get taken in by faulty business cases that assume AI can fully displace humans—as so many did when web-based self-service options came along. ✽✽✽ GM LEVERAGES AI IN SOCIAL CUSTOMER CARE GM, America’s largest automobile manufacturer, has more than 17 million social brand mentions and engages in more than 400,000 customer care conversations each year.

The chatbot also collects necessary information on “difficult to answer” inquiries before they are passed to an advisor. Goal 2: Push the boundaries of social care. The GM team set out to connect customers with the people making their products, to uncover actionable insights and improve the customer experience. They also wanted “early detection” of any product issues. GM harnessed AI to systematically mine social and digital conversations for product issues, engage the appropriate internal team to fix problems, and follow up with the customers who voiced the concerns.

    "paragraph": "Customers Are Better-Informed and Have Higher Expectations The growth and expansion of search, social media communities, mobile apps, self-service capabilities, a vast range of information resources, and ever-changing cultural expectations have created better-informed, more empowered, and savvy customers. As industry pioneer (and my former business partner at ICMI) Gordon MacPherson Jr. foresaw three decades ago, “A new breed of technology-sophisticated consumers is demanding a choice of how they will be served. They often know what the choices could be, and they will become increasingly critical if you do not offer the choices they think you should offer.” It’s up to you to open up and develop access and services as technologies and expectations evolve. All channels have a place. An agent won’t suffice when you want to review feedback from a diverse social media community. Speech recognition doesn’t illustrate movement in a financial market. Web-based services don’t come close to matching the proficiency of an experienced technical support agent. Your customers and their specific situations will dictate the best combination of channels, services, and technology. \"We think we invent technology, but technology also invents us.” RICHARD FARSON You’ll Always Need Agents—But for Different Reasons Quite a few industry pundits predicted that advanced self-service capabilities (along with a focus on simpler and more reliable products and services) would dramatically reduce reliance on agents. More recently, I’ve heard similar predictions from observers who are looking at developments in AI. Yet, there are more agents working in more contact centers across the globe than at any time in history. The consideration missing in much of the analysis is that communications capabilities are creating new services and expectations. This is not a zero-sum game. For those services that require the involvement of an agent, customers expect their issues to be resolved quickly and easily (see discussion of expectations, Chapter 2). This is putting a spotlight on the importance of agent empowerment. “Customers expect frontline employees to resolve problems on the spot,” write John Goodman and Scott Broetzmann in their eye-opening book, Strategic Customer Service. “This requires much more empowerment than companies are typically willing to impart. However, if you look at the cost of supervisor involvement to make a decision that will be the same 92 percent of the time, tripling the cost, it is cheaper to trust the frontline employee. Further, if you add the 10 to 20 percent drop in loyalty by forcing the customer to wait, and otherwise gumming up the works, the case for immediate resolution and trusting the frontline staff becomes compelling.” ✽✽✽"

    "paragraph": "THE CONTACT CENTER’S ROLE IN BUILDING SELF-SERVICE Many organizations are learning firsthand that contact centers play a central role in encouraging and supporting low-cost access channels. For example, the contact center can provide a wealth of information about which contacts can be automated or handled in customer communities, and what can be done to improve customer acceptance of this type of handling. While it may seem paradoxical, providing agent assistance when and as needed encourages customer confidence in these alternatives. Here are some things you can do to build self-service channels: ▪ Equip agents to educate customers on self-service options. They should be trained on the uses and advantages of these alternatives so that they can encourage customers to avail themselves of self-service options when appropriate. ▪ Collect and analyze data about contacts currently handled in the center. Look for opportunities to provide self-service features or to build communities that enable customers to help each other. ▪ Observe agents handling contacts. Your best agents really know how to serve customers; watching them work can present many opportunities for developing and improving self-service systems. ▪ Involve agents in system design. Your agents should actively serve on project teams responsible for building self-service systems. They can also help monitor and test systems and interpret customer behavior and feedback. ▪ Integrate self-service and contact center systems. Integrated systems can enable agents to use the information captured in self-service applications when they are assisting customers. ▪ Capture customer feedback about self-service systems. This information is essential to improving system design. ▪ Enable customers to easily reach agents. If customers can’t reach an agent when they want to, they will resent being forced to use self-service systems. ▪ Track data from all support modes and analyze it for improvement opportunities; specifically, why do customer contacts happen? Which do you want to encourage and which do you want to prevent (as much as possible)? If your contact center agents view self-service as a low-cost replacement for humans, they may not be overly enthusiastic about helping to improve those systems or encouraging their use. Turn this (misconception) on its head and you’ll be correctly positioning self-service systems as an essential part of providing choices and delivering high-value services. ✽✽✽ Agent-Assisted Services Are Being Prioritized Many of the contacts being handled today can be, will be and should be handled by self- service channels, emerging AI applications, and related options in coming years. This doesn’t mean that agents are, or will be, obsolete. Consider the travel sector.

Forward-thinking organizations are taking tangible steps to build self-service alternatives and encourage customers to use them. And leading contact centers are taking a proactive role in this effort. They are ensuring that their highly trained, highly paid agents are handling interactions that need the human touch. Contact Centers Require Increasingly High Levels of Skill Agents face a number of challenges as search, online resources, social media communities and self-service technologies offload relatively simple contacts, and as products and services grow increasingly diverse and complex. In addition to handling more difficult interactions, they must serve increasingly well-informed and varied customers; adjust to rapid changes in products, services, and technologies; operate in a time-sensitive, multimedia environment; communicate quickly and accurately in both verbal and written form; and understand (and be able to help customers use) technology-based services. At supervisory and management levels, the traditional “jack of all trades” roles are being divided among specialists doing, among other things, data analysis, scheduling, quality observation, and coaching. Some organizations have created contact center application specialists, who interact directly with IT or suppliers. Evolving technologies are powerful and enormously flexible, but they are contributing to the emergence of specialized managers with the expertise to understand, manage and maintain those technologies. An undeniable trend fueling further complexity is the addition of new channels and combinations of channels. While the core principles of effective management are timeless and universal, the operational specifics vary from one channel to another (see Chapter 7). And requirements at the agent level vary, even though the products and services being supported are similar. Phone, chat, text, video, and different social media platforms present nuances in cultural expectations and skill requirements. Organizations Are Being Redefined Many organizations are restructuring so that the customer experience is viewed more holistically, and so that all touchpoints are approached cohesively (see Chapter 16). This can necessitate significant internal structural change that involves IT, marketing, HR and virtually every other department. Job roles are changing along with organizational structures. Many organizations are also establishing an overall head of customer experience. As discussed in Chapters 13, 14 and 16, it is increasingly important that organizations invest in employees and provide attractive skill and career paths. Many organizations are also becoming more broadly-based. Multi-site centers and agents based at home have increased in number significantly in recent years.

Eventually, someone reasonable comes along and points out the necessity of including the primary customer-facing department in the digital transformation.” We’re Just Getting Started As advanced as some technologies have become, many are still in their infancy. Omnichannel is here to stay, and the distinctions among phone, chat, browsing, dialogue through social media channels, and video will blur—they’ll all just be conversations. We communicate best when our senses work together. Think about these ingredients, and ponder ways they can be combined: ▪ Mobile ▪ Social media ▪ Virtual ▪ Artificial intelligence ▪ Interactive ▪ Information ▪ Multimedia ▪ Network ▪ Community ▪ Virtual reality ▪ Engagement ▪ Experience These components will continue to be mixed and harnessed in numerous, yet-to-be-imagined ways.

Clear Business Thinking Is More Important Than Ever New technologies are not passive—to get good results, they must be implemented with foresight and good planning.

It turns out that it’s like hot pepper sauce—a little bit goes a long way, and the use and context must be precise. Similarly, today’s open and highly customizable systems offer wonderful flexibility, but (stating the obvious here) they need to be programmed to do what you want them to do. Clarification and definition of the underlying business rules is an ongoing challenge for any organization. And that has a lot more to do with clear business thinking than a specific technology capability. The late Peter Drucker contended that the most important impact of information technology is not the capabilities of the technologies themselves, but that these systems force you to organize processes and information more logically. Author Emily Yellin once summarized the opportunity this way: “Our billions of everyday transactions are both simpler and more complicated than they appear. But while the infrastructure that supports them is continually in flux, the intangibles at the heart of each positive encounter remain constant on all sides: trust, respect, empathy, caring, and even some fun—within companies, and between companies and their customers.” ✽✽✽ THE BUSINESS CASE A helpful way to consider the business case for contact center technologies is to broadly categorize the benefits in four areas: Foundational, required to support the contact center’s mission and strategy. Example: routing systems that enable the organization to identify and deliver to agents the full range of customer interactions. Legal, necessary to comply with requirements or minimize liability. Example: recording systems that enable interactions to be captured and stored for a defined period of time. Return on investment, where potential benefits exceed costs based on the organization’s accepted ROI approach (e.g., payback time, return on capital). Example: desktop capabilities that enable agents to access needed information more quickly, reducing handling times and boosting first contact resolution. Intangible, providing benefits that are more difficult to quantify but are believed to be worth more than the cost. Example: improvements to facilities that create a more pleasing work environment. (Note that in many cases, these investments can be estimated by looking at factors such as performance and turnover.) ✽✽✽ Leadership Is Essential Effective leadership in this time of intense change requires a multi-faceted approach, and some recommendations come to mind: 1.

Remember that new capabilities both depend on and dramatically affect (among other things) training, policies, planning, budgeting, and other systems. Those who take a holistic approach to planning and implementing systems, and who put adequate thought into process- and people-related issues, earn the highest returns on technology investments. 3. Recognize that just about any technology can be viewed as a double-edged sword. For example, quality observation capabilities can be sources of stress for agents. Or they can be used to identify improvement opportunities and coach agents to higher levels of performance and job satisfaction. Similarly, reporting tools that give people outside of the department access to contact center information may bring unwanted attention. Or such tools may be a boon to the interest level (and support) the contact center receives from other parts of the organization. Ensuring that others have an understanding of technologies and how they will be used is key. 4. It’s essential to develop a sound customer access strategy and use it to guide decisions (see Chapter 2). As you view technology possibilities though the lens of your customer access strategy, some key questions will surface, such as: Which technologies best support your plans and direction? How will processes need to change? What impact will the technology have on agent requirements, both in staffing numbers and skills required? What impact will it have on your cost structure—expenses and revenues? How will overall service be improved? How technologies are implemented, supported, and used is as important as the capabilities of the technologies themselves. The answers to these and related questions will help you make wise investments, and ensure that technology is being led by your mission and direction—not the other way around. 5. In a theme that has run throughout the book: Contact center leaders have the responsibility to evaluate how technology can add value to the organization and customers, and build that into their business case. What impact will new capabilities have on customers, agents, other employees, or business functions? What are the benefits, and the returns on those benefits? 6. Inaction is the worst action you can take. Given the pace of change, it’s important to now decide on and map your contact center’s migration into the future. ✽✽✽ Points to Remember ‣ Advanced contact center technologies are creating enormous opportunities for better serving customers, empowering agents and increasing efficiencies and effectiveness. ‣ Technologies are not passive.

Organizational design is a strategy to help the organization reach its objectives; design helps translate strategy into operations. Answers to major questions, such as the contact center’s role in customer experience, to whom the center reports, and how the center will be positioned relative to other service delivery methods (e.g., the field sales force or physical locations), must flow from the highest strategic levels. ✽✽✽ THE IMPACT OF ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN"

There are many reasonable definitions of organizational structure, but almost all refer to both the division of labor and the coordination of responsibilities and tasks. Major issues defined or affected by organizational design include: ▪ The contact center’s position in the larger organization ▪ The contact center’s role in relation to other channels of service delivery (such as retail locations or field sales and service operations) ▪ The contact center’s overall mission and responsibilities ▪ Specific job roles and accountabilities ▪ Lines of communication and authority ▪ Agent group structure ▪ Analyst and support positions ▪ Ratios (e.g., staff-to-supervisor) ▪ Number of sites and level of integration ▪ Process, technology and facility requirements ▪ Budget allocations ✽✽✽ INFORMAL AND FORMAL STRUCTURES ARE WELL-ALIGNED. The formal structure is the one defined by organizational charts and in position and process descriptions. The informal structure is how things really function. I’ve run into a number of cases over the years where contact centers had grown their own ad hoc training and technology support functions (e.g., “Hey, Christine can do that … let’s ask her.”) because they weren’t getting timely support from other areas. If that’s the case in your organization, it’s time to sit down with people in those other areas and discuss what the contact center needs. Organizations are complex, and there will always be some degree of informal communication and workflow. But when an informal structure becomes ineffective, it’s important to re-examine the formal structure, as it could be the true source of the problem. Just as great sports teams define positions around natural talent and abilities, formal structures should flow efficiently along natural lines of authority and responsibility. ✽✽✽ STRATEGY DRIVES STRUCTURE Many contact centers have been through consolidations or restructurings that are really just cleanup efforts because they"

    "paragraph": "lacked an effective customer access strategy. For example, I helped an insurance company with agent group “consolidation.” Their sales team would sell an account to a major client and, if pressed, would agree to provide a dedicated agent group. After each sale, the contact center would be left to figure out how to provide those dedicated resources. The center pooled agent groups whenever possible, but they eventually reached the point at which they faced the near- impossible task of managing numerous agent groups, routing plans, overflow contingencies and access numbers. The purpose of the consolidation plan was to get a handle on all of the available access numbers and routing plans, and combine and simplify as much as possible. It was a painful effort, driven by decisions made in the absence of an overall plan. The contact center and sales teams now work from a common plan—leading to a cleaner and more effective organization, one that delivers far better customer experiences. ✽✽✽ AGENT GROUPS FORM THE FOUNDATION OF CONTACT CENTER STRUCTURE. Once the contact center’s place in the larger organization is defined, it should be built from agent groups upward. (Recall from Chapter 6 that agent groups share a common set of skills and knowledge, handle a specified mix of contacts, and can comprise a small number of agents in a single location, or hundreds of agents across multiple sites.) In an ideal world, every agent in a center would be equally proficient at handling every type of contact through any channel, speak all required languages, and maintain the company’s branding and image for every customer segment. That, of course, is not realistic in most environments—thus the tiered groups, skills-based routing and other alternatives that centers use to get the right contact to the right agent at the right time. Here’s the point: Everything—hiring, training programs, supervisory and management responsibilities, analyst activities, quality standards, workforce planning, you name it—is based on agent group structure. But as agent group requirements evolve, those supporting functions can become outdated. This is an issue that requires regular review. In light of your current agent groups, redefine the responsibilities of your analysts, bring supervisor ratios into sensible alignment, and rethink your training and development programs. ✽✽✽ ARE YOUR AGENT GROUPS TOO POOLED? TOO SPECIALIZED? There is no formula for deciding how pooled or specialized agent groups should be. However, the symptoms of groups that are too pooled or too specialized are usually evident. Symptoms of over-specialized agent groups: ▪ Small groups with low occupancy and/or erratic service level/response time results ▪ An overly complicated planning process ▪ Many contacts not handled by the intended group (e.g., due to overflow or reassigned agents) ▪ Agents frustrated with narrow responsibilities"

    "paragraph": "Symptoms of over-pooled agent groups: ▪ Customer interactions have a higher handling time than necessary as agents grapple with a broad range of issues ▪ There is a high number of transferred or escalated contacts ▪ Training time is relatively long ▪ Quality suffers ▪ Agents are frustrated with “too much to know” ✽✽✽ DIVISIONS AND RATIOS ARE SUPPORTED BY THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES. Any team, agent group, functional area, or location (unless networked seamlessly to other sites) is defined by dividing lines, and divisions should be justified by the highest priorities and continually reviewed. For example, after much analysis, a government organization decided to combine dozens of small, localized contact centers into a few larger, regionalized centers. They determined that overall service to constituents was a higher priority than satisfying the interests pushing to keep the jobs in each local community. In another example, a high-tech company with 24/7 technical support combined several daytime groups into a pooled group at night, which was equipped to handle a broad range of interactions. Although average handling time increased, quality remained consistent with daytime service. The organization (wisely) decided that the ability to reach a capable and fully- trained agent—even if they needed a bit more time handling the contact—wins out over maintaining small, specialized groups in the wee hours of the morning. REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS ASSIGN APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTABILITIES. There are situations in which the contact center is dependent on people in other areas that have different (or even competing) interests. Yes, everybody is ultimately on the same team. But when contact centers are being judged on their ability to handle a changing workload, the IT/telecom department is intent on operating within a reconfigured budget, and marketing is being assessed on response rates … that can cause problems. The answer? Sit down with colleagues across areas and identify objectives and accountabilities that could be in conflict. Maybe the training department should report to the same area as the contact center, or to the contact center itself. (And maybe some other support functions should be brought under the contact center umbrella.) Maybe some expenditures that are spread across the IT, marketing and customer service budgets should be combined. Answers begin to emerge when an open and honest needs assessment takes place. SUPPORT POSITIONS ARE ENABLERS. Roles geared around ensuring compliance, establishing rules, and creating exception reports are often counterproductive. Alternatively,"

Those in support roles must find a good balance between burdensome control and an organization so loosely managed that it loses effectiveness. THE STRUCTURE FACILITATES BRANDING. The organization’s desired image, how it wishes to define and serve customer segments, and the specific requirements of individual customers should drive objectives that span the organization’s marketing efforts, the products and services it provides, and the contributions of the contact center. While that doesn’t (necessarily) mean that separate divisions or agent groups within the center are required to serve different customer segments, it does mean that divisions, groups, and responsibilities should advance branding requirements. In a common example, many organizations are implementing customer experience initiatives designed to break down historical silos and provide a unified focus on customer needs. An important aspect of these efforts is better coordination across functional areas. THE ORGANIZATION IS DESIGNED TO BE NIMBLE. Finally, in a theme that runs throughout this book, the contact center should be designed and managed to be as scalable and flexible as possible. There are many considerations covered in prior chapters that go into creating a nimble organization: ▪ Having a thoughtful and current customer access strategy (Chapter 2) ▪ Establishing an accurate planning and management process (Part Two) ▪ Ensuring that everyone understands important contact center dynamics (Chapter 9) ▪ Building budgets that match requirements (Chapter 10) ▪ Implementing an appropriate approach to real-time management (Chapter 11) ▪ Establishing the right objectives and metrics (Chapters 12 and 14) ▪ Continuously improving processes and quality (Chapter 13) ▪ Harnessing technologies that enable and empower the organization (Chapter 15)"

The table below provides a look at how job titles and responsibilities can be defined in a larger contact center. Large centers tend to have more specialized roles and illustrate how responsibilities can become more specific. Smaller centers often combine some (or many) areas of responsibility when creating positions. In some of the smallest centers, the manager may wear most every hat —including acting as an agent at least part of the time. A glance through these roles and responsibilities underscores an important trend: from supervisors on up, management-level job roles are becoming increasingly specialized. Consider workforce management, and the emergence of forecasting, scheduling, and real-time management expertise. Similarly, quality initiatives depend on observation and coaching, program design, calibration, and data analysis. Technology can also lead to specialization, such as specific positions dedicated to managing or supporting speech or IVR, desktops, analytics, networks, quality observation systems, social media tools, or workforce optimization. (If you manage or support a small center, you may still take on many of these responsibilities.) Interestingly, at the agent level, job requirements are becoming more generalized.

Even within an industry, there can be a wide variance (one well-known retail company has several dozen agents per supervisor—not a number I recommend—while another has 10). Be careful about drawing quick conclusions based on these figures or industry benchmarks. There are no simple answers along the lines of, “If you are a such-and-such type of contact center, you ought to have X staff per supervisor.” Some of today’s trends are working to drive the span of control up, including: GROWING WORKLOADS. In some sectors, contact center workloads have consistently increased. In those centers that struggle to keep up with growth, the span of control tends to increase. BUDGET CONSTRAINTS. As organizations go through restructurings and/or budget cutbacks, they often must reduce the relative number of supervisors, which increases spans of control. Many senior managers admit that a downward adjustment of span of control would be ideal but say that funds are simply not available for more supervisor/manager positions. GROWTH OF TEAMS. A positive development has been the growth of team-based environments, which has challenged the traditional role of supervisors. Contact centers have largely moved toward organizations that are flatter and more team-oriented. In many cases, team leaders are assuming functions that traditionally have been the domain of managers and supervisors. LOWER TURNOVER. Another positive development is that a growing number of centers are directly and successfully reducing turnover. As the average experience level of agents moves upward, less supervision is generally required. Conversely, there are other developments in today’s environment that tend to drive span of control down, including: THE GROWING COMPLEXITY OF CONTACTS. As better technologies offload routine contacts, and as new contact channels open up and expand, agents are handling interactions that require more human savvy and know-how. The growing complexity of the work tends to necessitate more coaching and feedback delivered by supervisors and managers. MORE OBSERVATION AND COACHING. Many contact centers are employing more robust observation approaches and taking larger samples for coaching and development than in the past (see Chapter 14). Observations, feedback, and coaching take a significant amount of management time. HOURS OF OPERATION. Hours of operation can be a subtle but significant factor. Many"

    "paragraph": "organizations maintain a minimum number of supervisors, even during off-hour shifts that require proportionally fewer agents. MORE SMALL CONTACT CENTERS. This may be the biggest reason that the average span of control across the industry has moved down—there are simply more small groups. For example, if a new contact center has only seven or eight agents, it will likely have a supervisor even though that person will be able to supervise more people as the center grows. There are other factors that can confuse the span-of-control issue. For example, team structures vary widely from one organization to the next. Some utilize “lead agents” (team leaders) who provide support and guidance to agents while also handling contacts (this can lead to an increased span of control). In other organizations, supervisors are highly involved in strategic management responsibilities, which leads to a lower span of control. Additionally, the time that supervisors spend observing and coaching (generally the most time-consuming activity beyond handling contacts) can vary greatly. And many organizations have set up support teams to field inquiries from agents who need technology-related help—a responsibility previously handled by supervisors. Recommendations in business literature vary from “train them, empower them, and get out of the way” on one end of the spectrum, to a more structured approach on the other. In their classic book, Executive Leadership, authors Elliot Jacques and Stephen D. Clement mince no words: “There is more nonsense centering around the topic of span of control than around nearly any other subject in the whole field of organization and management.” They go on to criticize managers who search for “easy-to-apply rules of thumb that need no thought.” This is applicable to the contact center environment, as well. While somewhere between 8 and 12 agents per supervisor makes sense in many centers, a 5:1 or 20:1 ratio may be equally justifiable. I always get great insight when I ask agents themselves: Are you getting the support you need? What ratio would make sense for you and others who are part of the team? Supervisor-to-Manager Ratios As to supervisor-to-manager spans of control, ratios of between 5:1 and 12:1 are typical. Given the higher-level and more complex interactions that must take place between managers and supervisors, spans of control are usually smaller than those between agents and supervisors. This underscores a principle generally true in most organizations: the higher up in the organization, the smaller the span of control. Establishing Career and Skill Paths There are two general options for formal employee advancement: career paths and skill paths. A typical career path model requires the development of job families, which comprise a number of jobs arranged in a hierarchy by grade, pay, and responsibility (e.g., agent, team leader, supervisor, manager, senior manager, and director). The career path also outlines the requirements"

    "paragraph": "Because the historical corporate ladder approach to staff development can be limited for contact centers (due to the finite number of supervisory and management positions available), a more effective approach may be the skill path model. Skill paths focus on an individual’s acquisition of skill sets. Individuals often receive more recognition, responsibility, and compensation as they achieve new skill levels within their position. Contact centers, perhaps more than any other part of the organization, require diverse skills. Customer experience, information systems and technologies, queuing theory, forecasting, statistics, human resources management, training, written and verbal communication skills, reporting, real-time management and strategy are all components of the environment. Developing attractive career and skill paths is a significant opportunity to recognize the knowledge, skills and accomplishments of contact center staff. ✽✽✽ THE CLIO PATH Happy agents make happy customers. Right? That’s what the team at Clio—which provides practice management software for law firms—believes and lives. “The Clio Path” creates a clear and concise roadmap for development, says David Perry, Clio’s customer support manager, in an interview published in ICMI Contact Center Insider. “It encourages professional development, project management, and improvements to departmental procedures.” Dubbed “The CX Roadmap to Clio Success and Beyond,” all new employees work with their supervisors to complete a detailed (11-page!) career roadmap worksheet. Employees are instructed to work at their own pace, and to take ownership of the action items that result. There are five steps to the process: Step one involves self-discovery assessments. Employees are asked to map out where their career has taken them so far, to evaluate the highs and lows, and to consider their aspirations. Step two is refinement, intended to help employees narrow down their development goals. During this stage of the program, they’re encouraged to meet with colleagues in other departments and learn more about their day-to-day responsibilities. They’re asked to meet with potential mentors outside the organization, and to write down skills and resources they’ll need to advance in their career. Step three is exploratory, documenting key takeaways and goals. Step four requires employees to set their own personal development goals and tie them to deadlines and KPIs. For example: “By 2021, I’d like to be a thought leader in the customer experience space.” Steps/KPIs: ▪ Speak at one customer experience conference by mid-year 2020 ▪ Complete online CX certification course by the end of 2020 ▪ Contribute four thought leadership articles to industry publication by the end of 2020 Step five is execution. Team members identify an accountability buddy and share their goals and next steps.

    "paragraph": "Source: Interview with David Perry, in ICMI’s Contact Center Insider newsletter ✽✽✽ Customer-Focused Culture I recall a new restaurant with great food and impeccable service that quickly built a following. Referrals spread rapidly, reviews were positive, and before long, the waits to get in became longer. To customers, this was just confirmation the restaurant was a great choice. But over time, the food became less predictable, the service less consistent. They became complacent. And the word of mouth that was working for them began to work against them. In less than two years, they were out of business. Can this same complacency happen in contact centers? Of course—but you can avoid it and instead build a culture that is fun, focused, and passionate about the customer experience. What do organizations with the most customer-focused cultures have in common? Here are some traits that really stand out: THEY ESTABLISH A UNIFYING VISION. As discussed throughout the book, a vision and supporting strategy that pulls everyone together is critical (see Chapter 2). In The Service Culture Handbook, Jeff Toister states it well: “A customer service vision is the cornerstone of a customer-focused culture. It acts as a compass to get every employee pointed in the same direction.” THEY HIRE THE RIGHT PEOPLE. I had a successful customer service leader put their approach to me this way: “We hire the passion and train the skills.” I agree with this approach— while it makes sense (when possible) to recruit employees who have the skills you need, a drive and passion to help customers is a must-have in contact centers. THEY PUT THEIR EMPLOYEES FIRST. Southwest Airlines, one of the world’s most admired companies, states on their website that “In our ‘order of importance,’ we put our Employees first, then our Customers, then our Shareholders … We believe that, if we treat our Employees right, they will treat our Customers right, and in turn that results in increased business and profits that make everyone happy.” They also empower employees to make real- time decisions (see discussion in Chapter 11). You can’t expect them to be effective unless they have the authority and means to help customers. THEY COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY. Effective leaders at all levels, whether CEOs or supervisors of a group, keep their teams in the know. Good or bad, nobody is second-guessing or wondering. Effective leaders listen, intently and often. And they celebrate successes along the way. THEY KEEP THE FOCUS ON CUSTOMERS RATHER THAN INTERNAL OBJECTIVES. A large cable company with a mixed reputation for service (that they are working hard to change) recently took the symbolic step of putting an empty chair in every"

    "paragraph": "planning meeting, to represent the customer. Those involved say it really means something to have a tangible picture of a customer sitting in those discussions. It’s beginning to have an impact. (A utility goes even further—they bring in customers to talk to new customer service agents, and tell them things they like and things they would change about their experiences.) THEY ESTABLISH GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT SUPPORT A CUSTOMER- FOCUSED CULTURE. Here’s a non-contact center example I witnessed recently. A chain of hardware stores that set “the number of customers served” as a key performance factor realized they were missing opportunities. As they learned, the employee who points to the aisle where the wrenches are is not nearly as effective as one who walks the customer to the aisle, asks whether they have an Allen wrench to install the part they requested and, in the process, discovers that the project is part of a larger remodel. With a renewed focus on customers (and retooled performance metrics), this chain is seeing both customer satisfaction and business returns improve. Let’s look at some additional aspects of building customer-focused cultures—ones that also include the broader organization. Your Organization’s Personality Motorcycle company Harley Davidson has incredibly loyal customers. Riders join clubs and wear Harley clothes, and some even have Harley tattoos. Many CEOs and chief marketing officers point to Harley as the holy grail of customer loyalty, and wonder what they can do to be more like Harley. The answer: don’t be more like Harley. Be more like you. Connect with your customers in your own way to build excitement that is unique to your brand. Here are two examples. ▪ Northwestern Mutual, the U.S.-based financial services company founded well over a century ago, has built a reputation for stability. Their customer service is professional and effective. “Thank you, Mr. Cleveland. Enjoy the rest of your day.” ▪ MOO is a fast-growing London-based design and printing company. They encourage their team to (in their words) be passionate, lovely and ambitious. Their approach, like the company name, is more playful: “Have an awesome day, Brad!” In both cases, these companies’ unique personalities shine through—and it would create very odd customer experiences to swap their styles of service! I’m sometimes baffled to hear plodding phone menus (the monotone “press one for customer service”). And I don’t get service policies that are immediately overridden when customers plead their case to managers. It doesn’t have to be that way. Those are not best practices. I recently stayed at a resort hotel with my family on a short weekend break. We arrived on a hot Saturday evening, and my engine light came on as we pulled into the entry area. I mentioned the light to the parking attendant and he replied, rather brusquely, “If you have car trouble you need to move. We can’t have your car sit here.” No empathy, no suggestions on where I should"

    "paragraph": "I later mentioned this encounter to a manager. She was visibly embarrassed, saying, “That’s not our brand.” Her concern in those few words was genuine and heartfelt, and I have a feeling they’ll reshape the coaching and support they give their employees, to ensure their brand’s personality shines through from the very first hello. Customer Advocacy Customer advocacy is a hot topic in marketing and customer service circles, and for good reason. It can be a powerful part of building a strong brand and creating great business results. But what is it and how do you tap into it? If you do a search for customer advocacy, you’ll find two very different definitions. One is an internal perspective: focusing the organization on doing what’s best for customers, creating great experiences. The other is external: customers advocate for us, spreading the word about our products, services, and brand. Which is correct? Both! Well, both are half correct. Let’s put them together. We can define customer advocacy this way: “Customer Advocacy consists of the actions we take to focus the organization on doing what is best for customers, which, in turn, rewards us with loyal customers who advocate for our products and brand.” Customer advocacy can play out in small and big ways: ▪ It can help guide individual interactions. The reservation agent mentions to the customer that an earlier flight would save them $175. ▪ It can be the catalyst to more involved decisions, such as keeping your contact center open on weekends to match customer preferences. ▪ And it can be the driver of dramatic change. When the late Steve Jobs returned to Apple and revived its sagging revenues, he eliminated some products in which the company had invested heavily and focused on others that were aligned with customer needs. He said, “You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work back toward the technology—not the other way around.” That is customer advocacy at work. Customers are advocates when they positively promote your products and brand. Brand advocates, as they are often called, bring much value to the organization. A McKinsey study found that word of mouth drives 20–50% of all purchase decisions. And according to Bain & Company, customer advocates spend two times more than other customers, and because they stay longer, have a customer lifetime value five times greater. Turning customers into brand advocates requires adherence to solid principles. The first and most important: don’t forget the real reason you have loyal customers in the first place. Solve problems for them and serve them well through great products and customer-focused service. Ensuring that this happens should be a key focus of customer service leadership. Second, make sure your contact center is in the game—that it’s interacting with customers “where they are.” A colleague who recently shopped online for a blender found the choices"

Their comments were right there below the reviews. Many of those same customers later posted very positive updates. She went with the brand that was engaged. Third, involve the rest of the organization. Here’s an example: UL, a large company providing safety testing and certification services, got inspired to capture on-the-fly feedback their employees were hearing from customers every day. They created a simple feedback form inside their CRM system. The link can be accessed quickly by any employee at any time. They can easily pull up the form from a mobile device and enter the customer’s feedback in real time. Nate Brown, who spearheaded the effort, says, “This has been a complete game changer in how well we understand our customers.” UL also has a robust process for analyzing and acting on feedback captured. Employees in any department love having a dedicated channel for customer feedback—if it’s easy to use. And in challenging situations, they can confidently tell customers, “I appreciate your feedback, and I will pass this on to our team.” A main takeaway that UL and others have learned: true omnichannel goes beyond just integrating channels in the contract center. It involves an organization-wide focus on customer experience, facilitated by governance that supports seamless and consistent service. True omnichannel goes beyond just integrating channels in the contract center. It involves an organization-wide focus on customer experience, facilitated by governance that supports seamless and consistent service. Fourth, encourage customers to write reviews. I bought a new pair of sports headphones recently, and received an email from the company founder. “We’re passionate about providing great products and service,” he said. It included the company’s contact information (access to the contact center) and encouragement to reach out with any question or issue. “Oh, and if you like your new sports headphones, would you be willing to provide a testimonial?” It was genuine and effective. Finally, for your most active brand advocates, consider a more involved level of engagement, such as VIP, loyalty, or inner circle programs. Recognize them, engage with them, and make them your “eyes and ears” for new ideas and innovation opportunities. LEGO engages with its customers through design contests, robotics challenges, and fun stories on Facebook and other sites that introduce new products. (For some additional compelling examples, go to YouTube and search for Red Bull, GoPro, or Patagonia to see how they engage with biking, surfing, and other sports communities, earning tens of millions of views.) Connecting and engaging with advocates is a strategic decision. It involves your contact center but also focuses the rest of the organization on your customers.

    "paragraph": "Would you go to a game and wait until your team won to cheer? Of course not! If you’re like me, you’d be cheering all along the way. Celebrating progress is essential, and it sure makes things a lot more fun. Whether the wins are big or small, celebration has several significant benefits for your organization: ▪ It leads to a “mindset of success.” Acknowledging the achievement of even small milestones puts success front and center, making it both familiar and a foundation to build on. ▪ It opens up the big picture. When you celebrate your team’s achievements, it gives you an opportunity to talk about how your project or initiative contributes to the organization’s overall success (how you’re helping to achieve a broader mission). ▪ It’s a motivator. People want to believe they’re doing work that’s worthwhile. Celebrating milestones, especially when done in light of the “bigger picture,” reinforces the value of your team. ▪ It builds team spirit. Having your team take a breather from work to celebrate progress you’re making is a great way to build “esprit de corp” (group spirit), which leads to unity of purpose. The most successful leaders make celebrating success a priority. They don’t fall prey to the most-cited reasons why it doesn’t happen, including: ▪ “I’m sure people know that we’re on target.” However, your team members are likely working on different aspects of customer service initiatives and might not have insight into whether they are on target or not. ▪ People will get complacent if they think things are going well.” Actually, celebrating wins motivates and prevents complacency. It’s dead wrong to assume you have to achieve a large goal in order to celebrate. ▪ And of course, “There’s not enough time.” But there’s always enough time to do the things that matter most. This is one of those things that can make a big difference. A central responsibility of leadership is to keep your contact center and the broader organization focused, unified, and working toward the right goals. Be engaged in the game— don’t wait for the closing buzzer. Find ways to celebrate along the way! ✽✽✽ UNIFYING DISTRIBUTED TEAMS Information and communications technologies have created organizations that span geography and time. Multi-site environments, cross-functional teams, and extended-hour or 24/7 operations are common contact center examples. If you are a manager or director, you may have the responsibility of getting results from those who work in different locations, who don’t report to you, or who don’t work the same hours."

    "paragraph": "Unfortunately, technology hasn’t eliminated the natural barriers that exist between people who work in distributed environments. Those who work in different places and/or at different times often have trouble seeing themselves as an integral part of a larger team. Like leadership in general, there’s no specific recipe for building a cohesive virtual team. However, there are tried-and-true steps you can take that will significantly increase your chances for success: ▪ Create a clear vision for the contact center. ▪ Create opportunities for the people in the distributed environment to get to know each other. (For example, I know of a manager who set up an internal webpage profiling the members of a multi-site team, occasionally giving everyone a short quiz on the interests and backgrounds of fellow members. Others are tapping into video-based meetings, internal social communities, and other approaches to bring people together.) ▪ Look for ways to keep everyone involved. Time must be spent (even if it’s in short supply) to foster a collaborative environment. ▪ Take steps to ensure that everyone gets key information at the same time. ▪ Spend proportionately more time tending to the needs and relationships of the more “distant” members of the group. (Distant may mean the members who work the night shift, work primarily at home, or are in a site thousands of miles away.) ▪ Look for ways to scrap (or at least minimize) the impact of unnecessary hierarchies and cumbersome bureaucracies, which tend to wreak havoc on distributed teams. ▪ Consistently communicate and celebrate progress. It’s important to keep the group updated and on the same track. The challenges of leading a distributed team are real and ongoing, but being part of an environment in which people successfully work together across distance and time is one of the most rewarding professional experiences you can have. In today’s world, it’s also one of the most necessary. ✽✽✽ The Highest Level of Leadership For several years, I facilitated workshops for new managers of a financial services company. The training occurred annually, over the course of a week. This gave me a view into the organization that was like time lapse photography. The VP of customer service in the early years was charismatic, with a big personality. The organization produced good results, and he was highly regarded as an effective leader. When he left for another opportunity, the organization lost its way and struggled for many months. Another VP came onboard. Eventually, however, the new VP found her footing. She had a quiet, very understated leadership style, but I could see strength in the organization began to return. She, too, eventually moved to a different position, but the organization’s successes continued. The first VP was an effective leader. He set clear goals, created an engaged environment, and enabled the team to achieve high levels of performance. But he was such a big presence that when he left, the organi"

Collins’s framework provides insight into the progression of leaders: ▪ Level 1 is a capable individual, who contributes talent, knowledge, skills, and good work habits. ▪ Level 2 is a contributing team member who works well with others to produce results. ▪ Level 3 is a competent manager who can organize employees and resources, to attain results. ▪ Level 4 is an effective leader who catalyzes commitment to a vision and rallies support to achieve high levels of performance. ▪ Level 5 is the leader who possesses the combination of humility and a ferocious will for the organization to be remarkable. Their focus is on leaving the organization stronger and ensuring that it can sustain success. Collins and his team refer to the mirror and window to differentiate behavior between level 4 and level 5 leaders. Level 5 leaders look out the window to credit others for success, and look in the mirror to take responsibility when things don’t go as planned. Charismatic leaders who haven’t reached level 5 tend to do just the opposite: they look out the window to find reasons for failure and look in the mirror to take credit when things go well. If your team falls apart when you’re not available, there’s probably opportunity to clarify responsibilities, further empower your employees, and improve processes, tools, and training to reduce dependencies. Can you go on vacation without checking in? That’s a sign that you’ve probably built a team or an organization that’s working. (And you deserve that vacation!)

Please just get to the point, I’ll often be thinking to myself in courses, plodding through reports, or reading business books that sometimes drone on. So the logic of jumping to the last chapter appeals to me. But here’s the thing. There are no shortcuts to providing consistently great service. There is no “executive summary” that will equip you to understand and build an effective contact center. I wish there were. In fact, I contemplated providing an appendix for this edition with detailed summaries of what is covered in each chapter—one page each. In the end, I decided that would be a disservice. Why? Consider a comparison to customer service. Just think about how annoyed you are when you need help and the customer service agent can only relay basic talking points. You want to engage in a conversation with a real person—someone who understands more deeply, and who is truly empowered to help. Sure, you can go through the book as you choose, in an order and at a speed that makes sense for you—with (hopefully) highlighter or pen in hand. Your highlights and notes become the summary.

(If you have followed prior editions, or ICMI’s reports on this topic, there used to be 12 traits of the best-managed contact centers. They are all still here—we’ve just simplified and consolidated them into seven.) 1. They Deliver Significant Value The most effective contact centers have a relentless focus on creating value for their organizations and customers. Far too many organizations are focused primarily on one level or one dimension of value: deliver to deliver services efficiently, improve revenues, or boost customer satisfaction, and so on. While those are good goals, the best organizations have their sights set higher. They align their resources, strategy, and culture to deliver maximum value on all three levels (see Chapters 1 and 13): efficiency, customer loyalty, and strategic value. Some centers I’ve worked with are referred to as \"R&D Machines\" by their organizations (R&D as in research and development) because of the insight they capture during interactions, share with other departments, and use to continually create better products and services. After all: ▪ It’s the contact center that first sees early warning signs of product or service glitches. ▪ It’s the contact center that best knows how well you keep your promises to customers. ▪ It’s the contact center that knows firsthand when communication is unclear or where systems don’t work as intended. ▪ And it’s those in the contact center who can so clearly see where there are opportunities to innovate and better meet customer needs."

But it takes the right management approach to make sure these opportunities don’t slip through your fingers. By maximizing value on all three levels, effective contact centers achieve a fourth level of value—the ultimate value these services provide to customers. What really happens when customers can access the services they need, seamlessly and easily? What is the impact on their economic situation? Their peace of mind? Their families? After facing enormous challenges and tragedy, GM is now engaging with customers across channels (see Chapters 10 and 15). Customer service has become an engine of quality improvement, innovation, and brand advocacy. I’ve seen scores of other organizations similarly discover the true potential of their contact centers. 2. They Build a Customer-Focused Culture Culture tends to guide behavior, and it can either support or ruin the best-laid plans. While there is no guaranteed formula for creating a supporting culture, many experienced managers agree that shaping culture—or, more correctly, enabling it to flourish—is an important leadership responsibility. One of the most critical aspects of managing a successful contact center is to provide services that satisfy changing consumer demands. Those that fall behind pay a steep price: dissatisfied customers, insufficient support from the organization and low morale. But those who stay ahead of the curve enjoy strong customer loyalty and the many benefits that come with it. The stakes are high.

Consequently, continually improving services to meet evolving customer expectations is a mandate in today’s environment. In leading contact centers, the ten customer expectations (see Chapter 2) are an important part of the organization’s development and culture. The list is sometimes prominently posted or even memorized by employees, and works its way into everything from strategy to process design to day-to-day planning and coaching activities. In short, the best-managed centers have a relentless focus on customers’ ever-evolving needs and expectations. They know that what worked yesterday will not necessarily work tomorrow. They are continually redefining plans and reshaping services around those expectations. How else do leading contact centers create high-performance cultures? How do they communicate their mission and values in a way that gets buy-in and alignment? There are notable characteristics that stand out: ▪ They have a compelling vision that gets everyone on the same page. ▪ They have—and use—an up-to-date customer access strategy, which ensures that everyone is pulling in the same direction (see Chapter 2). ▪ They ensure that everyone across the contact center and larger organization has an understanding of their contribution to the organization and its customers (see the first characteristic). ▪ They have a people-first perspective (see the next characteristic). ▪ They cultivate a collaborative planning process so that their operations run smoothly, enabling them to focus on higher-level issues that matter most. ▪ They get needed budget and support from their organizations (Chapters 10 and 16). Michael O’Leary, CEO of no-frills Ryanair, says he learned the importance of customer service the hard way. He once dismissed it, “We don’t want to hear sob stories. What part of ‘no refund’ don’t you understand?” That was until he faced huge operating losses and Ryanair was named by one source as the second-worst brand in the world. After a change in perspective and many improvements to service, O’Leary later looked back and said, “If I had known being nicer to our customers was going to work so well, I would have done it years ago.” 3. They Know That Their People Are the Key to Success"

    "paragraph": "Cultures vary dramatically from one organization to the next. Harley Davidson, MOO, and Clio have very different cultures (see Chapters 2 and 16). Their organizations’ unique personalities shine through—and swapping their styles of service would create very odd customer experiences. But in each case, a people-first philosophy is evident. Southwest Airlines, consistently one of the world’s most admired companies, explains their approach this way: “In our ‘order of importance,’ we put our employees first, then our customers, then our shareholders. Many companies feel you have to appease the customers or shareholders first … We believe that, if we treat our employees right, they will treat our customers right, and in turn that results in increased business and profits that make everyone happy.” The most important implication of the trends discussed throughout the book, and particularly in Part Four and Five, is clear: your people are the key to success. 4. They Cultivate Effective Processes Discussing processes can sometimes make eyes glaze over. But effective processes are essential, and their value cannot be overstated. The most effective contact centers view processes holistically and strategically, and several themes stand out: They view the contact center as a total process. The reality is that the contact center is an important part of a much bigger process. That has been a theme throughout the book, and it takes many forms: ▪ Ensure that everyone in the contact center, and those with key supporting roles outside the center, have a basic understanding of how contact centers operate (encourage them to read Chapters 9 and 10!). ▪ Recognize that the process is where most quality problems occur—and also where the opportunities for service improvements and cost reductions exist (Chapter 13). ▪ Take the initiative in coordinating with other departments (Chapters 13 and 16). ▪ Empower your employees to respond to changing conditions, and give them the authority to resolve issues in real time (Chapter 11). Without exception, they have a collaborative planning process. Effective planning is a central theme in Parts Two and Three of this book. A major objective of good planning is to get the right number of skilled people and supporting resources in place at the right times, doing the right things. But systematic planning accomplishes more than that. It also improves communication and culture by creating a body of information that wouldn’t otherwise be available, compels people to look into the future and see their work in the context of a larger framework, and encourages communication about values—issues such as resource allocations and workload priorities. Largely due to effective planning, great contact centers work so well that they are almost"

    "paragraph": "transparent. The teams concentrate on delivering the organization’s services and on building the organization’s value and brand—the effective operation of the contact center becomes a given. These effective contact centers also establish and focus on the right metrics. As discussed in Chapters 12 through 14, metrics are plentiful and it’s easy to get buried in information—or worse, focus on the wrong things. The contact centers that get the best results from using their reports and information have several things in common: ▪ They focus on a relatively small number of metrics and objectives that support their mission and direction. They know that trying to focus on too many things is counterproductive. ▪ They ensure that measurements are as accurate, complete, and unbiased as possible. They are aware of how easily statistics can be misinterpreted. They view reports in light of how they relate to each other. They know that a single report, outside the context of the others, can lead to erroneous conclusions. ▪ They understand that simply tracking high-level measurements won’t improve results. Instead, they work on the root causes—the factors behind these outputs. Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh is so adamant that employees focus on building relationships and making emotional connections (rather than making sales), that he has held “longest call” contests. One record-breaking call exceeded ten hours! Are long interactions the point? Of course not. And do long interactions equate to better connection? Not necessarily. But Zappos, an online retailer in a price-sensitive sector, has concluded that they don’t want upselling or revenue as their primary goal for individual interactions. They want to build relationships and then see good things follow. 5. They Effectively Leverage Technology As discussed in Chapter 15, new technologies are not passive—they are changing customer expectations, creating power shifts in organizations, and impacting the responsibilities of agents and managers. The best contact centers identify the technologies that further the mission of the organization, and they implement them with foresight, planning, and training. They also recognize that an important (according to the late Peter Drucker, the most important) impact of technology is not the capabilities of the technologies themselves, but that they require you to organize your processes and information more logically. The most effective contact centers have systems that are supported by processes designed to ensure information on customers, products, processes, and services is current and accurate. For example: ▪ Their knowledge management systems work because they make entering and updating knowledge a priority at the point of contact. ▪ Their quality monitoring systems are valuable because they have clearly defined quality and what needs to happen to support the organizations’ highest-level objectives."

    "paragraph": "▪ Their reporting systems provide essential support for making sound business decisions because they produce accurate information on the right things, delivered to the right people at the right times. ▪ AI, chatbots, and other emerging capabilities are viewed and implemented in the context of their customer access strategies, with a focus on what’s best for their customers. In short, the most effective contact centers respect what technology can do, but they know that it’s of little use without supporting processes and a clear direction. Some have the latest capabilities; others don’t—but they use what they have to support their mission and most important objectives. 6. They Get the Budget and Support They Need Far too many contact centers are operating under the philosophy of, “Okay, these are the resources we’re willing to give you, and this is what we want you to achieve …” That’s putting the cart before the horse. Here’s an analogy. Airlines couldn’t possibly operate a flight without a tangible connection between the results they want to achieve and the supporting resources they need. They start with an objective—fly 300 people from Frankfurt to Dubai. The objective is not a wishful goal, but a specific predetermined outcome supported by carefully calculated resources. Similarly, the best contact centers first decide on the objectives they want to achieve. Then they allocate the resources necessary to support those objectives, through informed calculations and disciplined planning (as discussed in Chapters 4 through 10). Support also very much depends on building customer-focused organizations (see Chapter 16). They encourage collaboration, harness the principles of effective organizational structure, and continually work on identifying the positions they need and the responsibilities that go along with them. They focus on what matters and they celebrate successes along the way. Sarah Gibart is Education and Quality Supervisor for Gopher Sport, a leading supplier of physical education, athletics, and fitness products. She and several of her colleagues recently won awards from ICMI for the innovative work they are doing in the contact center. Gibart recalls her journey over the past 12 years: “I had no contact center experience before walking in the door.” She credits mentors “who were there for me the whole way. That is what I experienced from the very beginning and I really wanted to give that back and watch people grow and be successful.” Bravo, Sarah! This principle (core value) of helping others succeed is one I’ve repeatedly seen in the most successful organizations. 7. They Continuously Innovate Apple founder Steve Jobs once commented: “I think Henry Ford once said, ‘If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me: a faster horse!’” Whether Ford actually said that is disputed, but he (and Jobs) certainly lived by the underlying principle: people don’t"

    "paragraph": "know what they want until you show it to them. The most successful contact center teams continually review and reassess how they do things and the results they are achieving. What can be improved? What should be scrapped? What assumptions no longer make sense? What can be done differently? They agree with the advice of management consultant Dr. Ichak Adizes, who reminds us, “You don’t know what you don’t know until you know it … The right solution is a continuous search for the right solution.” Where to from Here? The contact center profession has come a long way in recent years. Customer expectations are high, and for good reason. Many contact centers have learned how to deliver. But things are changing rapidly, and some in our profession view the future with at least some apprehension. They fear the impact and uncertainties that new capabilities (such as AI or emerging social media platforms) bring. They contemplate the increasingly diverse and complex interactions their centers will handle. They wonder how they’re going to keep up. It’s important to remember, though, that the very things causing uncertainties are also bringing the most significant opportunities. More than ever, organizations need professionals who can help them sort through these changes and make sound business decisions. By virtually any measure, there’s a shortage of leaders who really understand the unique contact center environment and how to deliver great business results. Clearly, contact centers are becoming increasingly complex to operate, and that trend will continue. But if you know and practice the principles covered in this book, you’ll have a big head start. Contact centers are becoming increasingly complex to operate…but if you know and practice the principles covered in this book, you’ll have a big head start. We have become a communication-oriented economy. In many ways, we are all pioneers in creating the next generation of services—services our customers will come to expect, our organizations will depend on and our economy will require. We have more opportunity right now than at any time in the history and growth of the contact center profession to shape services that have a positive impact. This is the most exciting season of development yet. The opportunities are there for the taking—this is the new era of customer experience. Thank you for joining me on this journey!"

A statistical model used in forecasting. As in simple smoothing, the average actual workload for a set number of past weeks is used to forecast the workload for the next week, but it is a weighted average, as each of the past weeks is weighted so that older weeks weigh less heavily than more recent weeks. Weeks can be weighted based on events (such as billing) that impact the workload for that week or simply based on length in the past. Whisper Transfer.
