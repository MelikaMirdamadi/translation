They include: 1. DEGREE OF MOTIVATION. How important is the interaction to customers? What are the consequences to them of not getting through? How badly do they need the product or service? For example, customers experiencing a power outage will usually wait longer to reach their utility than those with billing questions. 2. AVAILABILITY OF SUBSTITUTES. Even though they are highly motivated to initiate a contact, customers who encounter difficulties may abandon if they know of another way to get help. Self-service, communities found online, or even physically going to a retail location are examples of substitutes. If customers are highly motivated and have no acceptable alternatives, they will generally wait a long time in queue (and will retry if they get busy signals). Even though they do not abandon, they still might be very unhappy about the experience. 3. COMPETITION’S SERVICE LEVEL. If it’s easier for customers to use competitive services and if they have a tough time reaching you, they may go elsewhere. (You’ll need to consider whether competition is available in a practical sense. For example, if you are a bank and a customer has a problem with an online payment, a competitive bank is not going to be able to help—although if the problem is difficult to get resolved, the customer may decide to take their future business elsewhere.) It’s also important to consider that a contact center is often its own competition—customers may choose incorrect routing selections in the IVR or simultaneously try other channels just to reach an agent…any agent…more quickly. This leads to transferred contacts, inaccurate reports, longer handling times and other problems. 4. LEVEL OF EXPECTATIONS. The experiences customers have had with the contact center and the reputation that the organization has for service have a direct impact on tolerance.",

Others aren’t convinced that forecasting is worth the time. Yep, it takes time—but not nearly as much as some imagine. Further, a good forecast will save a lot of time later on. 2. AN ASSUMPTION THAT “THE FORECASTING SOFTWARE KNOWS BEST.” If you have forecasting software or a workforce management system, don’t relinquish decisions to the program, assuming that it knows best.

In fact, in the example, you could have 60 agents rush in and handle all 60 interactions just before the promised response time and still meet your objective. What you are really doing is looking for an efficient way to distribute the workload across your schedules within the promised response time. ▪ The basic response time formula assumes a “static” amount of work to be completed—in other words, you have a defined amount of work that has already arrived and is waiting to be processed. However, contacts that can be deferred arrive throughout the day in patterns that are often similar to service level-type traffic. With 24-hour response time objectives, projected workload can simply be built into the following day’s staffing requirements. But if you have more aggressive response time objectives, you’ll need to look at both on-hand workload and projections by interval to determine staffing requirements. ▪ When response time objectives are less than an hour, use Erlang C or computer simulation to calculate base staff. This would be a queuing and service level scenario, like inbound calls. ▪ Breaks, absenteeism and other activities that keep agents from the work need to be added to base staff calculations (a step we’ll cover in Chapter 8). ▪ An “efficiency factor” acknowledges that agents cannot handle one interaction after another with no “breathing” time in between. For example, if you want to build in an efficiency factor with a ceiling of 90 percent, divide base staff calculations by .9 to determine if additional agents are required.",

In many cases, outbound contacts to customers or prospects can be scheduled based on factors such as convenience to customers, highest probability of making successful connections, etc. Within these blocks of time, outbound contacts can be generated and handled one after another. Base staff requirements can be calculated using traditional response time calculations; for example, a minimum of five agents would be required to handle 20 hours’ worth of contacts in four hours’ time.

Too often, contact centers have extra work outside of the schedule that is unaccounted for but that exacts a heavy price on morale and quality when it’s ignored for too long (e.g., unfinished projects, administrative work, reading updates, coaching sessions, and case work). Take an inventory of activities that is as comprehensive and specific as possible. 4. RESOLVE THE “POWER STRUGGLES.” If “power struggle” sounds a bit dramatic, you ought to see some of the challenges those in forecasting and scheduling roles have encountered: requests from other areas preempting schedules, unplanned marketing campaigns, unannounced schedule exceptions among agent teams, and unclear lines of authority between supervisors and workforce planners. These challenges are not insurmountable—unless they go unaddressed. Educating supervisors and agents on the basics of forecasting and scheduling is an important part of the solution! 5.

Using the scenario in the table, assume that you have 46 agents handling contacts and, therefore, will be able to achieve a service level of 80/20. Here’s how the calculations produced an estimated 37.6 hours on the trunks: ▪ First, you can see that customers will be queued for agents an average of 13 seconds (ASA) and will be connected to agents an average of 180 seconds (average talk time), for a total of 193 seconds. The 180 seconds represents the forecast for what average talk time will likely be; the 13 seconds ASA comes from the Erlang C calculation. ▪ Because the table provides volume for a half hour, double 350 contacts to assume 700 contacts in an hour. ▪ Because the 700 calls spend an average 193 seconds queuing for and connected to agents, the trunk load in seconds is 135,100 seconds (700 contacts × 193 seconds). ▪ Finally, because trunk load is presented in erlangs (hours of traffic over the course of an hour), divide 135,100 by 3,600 (the number of seconds in an hour) and you come up with 37.6 hours. To use the correct telecom lingo, you’ll have the equivalent of 37.6 erlangs of traffic on the trunks for this agent group during this time period.

Develop good working relationships with the individuals who run other areas of the organization. Learn about their goals and objectives and how the contact center might best support their needs. ▪ Build an understanding of the contact center’s role and potential. Ensure that the prevailing perspective is that the role of the center is to serve other parts of the organization, not to point out flaws. ▪ Build a team that is focused on capturing, analyzing, sharing, and using value-added information across the organization. A suggested ratio is that you need one business analyst for every 30 to 50 agents. The ideal ratio depends on many factors, but will become clearer once you get started. ▪ Ensure that quality at the point of customer contact is given the broadest possible definition (e.g., that coaching, quality observation and objectives at the agent level are all considered essential elements of these major strategic opportunities). ▪ Define assumptions and unknowns in reports and data. Ensure that everyone understands where the data comes from and what definitions are in place. Strategic decisions based on misinterpreted reports can be worse than if there were no reports at all. ▪ Get the best tools you can. Analytics and performance management systems can help you analyze content, detect trends and causal factors, and identify improvement opportunities. Get started even if you don’t have these capabilities, but work toward acquiring and building supporting technologies. ▪ Don’t get overwhelmed. There is a ton of information that you could provide to each business unit. Instead of focusing on quantity (by trying to ensure that everything that may be valuable is shared), concentrate on providing the information that is likely to be most useful.",

Specific feedback and coaching is the most essential part of the observation and coaching process and is what ultimately improves quality.

Some contact centers do not share scores with agents until after the coaching session. ▪ The scoring system should directly reflect contact center objectives, objectives for interactions, and the behaviors you want to encourage. A flawed system may underemphasize critical behaviors and overemphasize non-essential skills. ▪ Confirm the mathematical validity of the scoring system, especially if a total score is compiled or the system is weighted. ▪ Establish the validity of the system by testing it before it can have an impact on individuals (e.g., before scores are included as part of performance-based pay). ▪ Understand that agents become very interested in scoring systems if they are tied to bonuses, performance evaluations and salary reviews. Be prepared to handle their questions and concerns. ▪ When possible, define variations in specific behaviors associated with a skill and the corresponding scores (e.g., what behaviors earn a 1 or a 3 or a 5?). ✽✽✽",

Your best agents really know how to serve customers; watching them work can present many opportunities for developing and improving self-service systems. ▪ Involve agents in system design. Your agents should actively serve on project teams responsible for building self-service systems. They can also help monitor and test systems and interpret customer behavior and feedback. ▪ Integrate self-service and contact center systems. Integrated systems can enable agents to use the information captured in self-service applications when they are assisting customers. ▪ Capture customer feedback about self-service systems. This information is essential to improving system design. ▪ Enable customers to easily reach agents. If customers can’t reach an agent when they want to, they will resent being forced to use self-service systems. ▪ Track data from all support modes and analyze it for improvement opportunities; specifically, why do customer contacts happen?
