(I mention these examples in Chapter 1.)\nIt’s really quite amazing. When it’s set up well, we as customers can—right now— reach\nsomeone who cares and who has the expertise and resources to help.\nIt’s been almost 25 years since the first edition of this book was introduced. The response\nsurpassed our highest expectations, and we were excited and grateful to see the book reach so\nmany corners of the world. The book, now in its fourth edition, has evolved significantly since\nthat first edition. Social media, smartphones, artificial intelligence (AI), new mobile- and\nInternet-based services—to name just a few of the developments in the years since—have\nchanged the game. And yet, for all the exciting developments, I’m a bit surprised at how little the\ncore management principles have changed.\nSo…if you’ve read any of the first three editions, you’ll see some things that are familiar.\nThis was an extensive update and rewrite, but we didn’t try to change the unchangeable—the\nprinciples that are tried and true. You can trust the continuity in those core areas that will never\nchange. You’ll also find much that’s new: managing omnichannel, new sections on customer\naccess strategies, empowering employees, using metrics, customer advocacy, the impact of AI,\nand (above all) the strategic role of contact centers.\nMy career began underneath contact centers. One of my first jobs was with an interconnect\ncompany that supplied telecommunications and data systems. I was the lowest-ranking person on\nthe team, and my primary responsibility was to install cabling. This was often underneath floors,\nthrough tight, dark spaces with spider webs, scalding hot utility pipes, and creatures that would\nscurry just out of flashlight range.\nThere’s a popular expression of starting one’s career on the “ground floor.” Much of the\ntime, I just wanted to get back up to the ground floor! But I had some great mentors and, with\ntheir help and encouragement, began to get excited about the communications era and how it’s\nrapidly changing our world."

Management\nmethods, processes, and technologies (which you will learn about in the chapters that follow) are\nenablers. But the essence of the contact center lies elsewhere—in one person conversing with\nand connecting with another.\nIn my consulting work over three decades, it’s been my privilege to sit next to hundreds of\ncustomer service agents, across many industries, as they’ve made these connections in the course\nof their daily work. Sure, there are the routine interactions that neither the customer nor the agent\nwill remember for very long, but I have witnessed many calls for help that were full of emotion\nand significance.\nThere was the homeowner who needed urgent assistance from her insurance company after a\nnatural disaster destroyed her family’s home; the retiree not sure how to access the benefits he\nworked for all of his life; the scared mother of a small child who accidentally ingested a\nhousehold product; the manager struggling to get her computer working before the biggest\npresentation of her young career; the person newly diagnosed with a frightening medical\ncondition whose outreach was the first step in the treatment journey.\nIf you think about it, it’s amazing. When it’s set up well, we can—right now—reach\nsomeone who cares and who has the expertise and resources to help.\nThere were many developments that had to happen to enable these connections to take place.\nSo … just for a moment … let’s go back and see how it all got started.\nThe Birth of Instant Communication\nIf you’re in Washington D.C. and have the opportunity, consider a visit to Hotel Monaco.\nThe ultra-high ceilings and classical architecture are amazing. The building was the city’s\noriginal post office and, more significantly, where inventor Samuel B. Morse opened and\noperated the first public telegraph office.\nTelegraph enabled the transmission of Morse code, a signaling system of short and long"

You get a sense of the\nawe that this new technology inspired in the words of the first transmission Morse sent on May\n24, 1844: “What hath God wrought?”\nI believe Morse and others who were there that day got a glimpse into an astonishing future\n—instant communication across vast distances. I can only imagine their wonderment had they\nlived to see the communication capabilities we now carry in the palms of our hands. The immediacy of telegraph helped inspire other advancements in communication. The\ntelephone, invented in 1876, quickly became part of everyday life. And it had a big advantage\nover telegraph: it could be used by anyone, with no special training required. Its ease of use led\nto rapid growth—a parallel we see today in smartphones. Immediate communication became the new normal. French artist Pierre Puvis de Chavannes\nwrote, “By the wondrous agency of electricity, speech flashes through space and, swift as\nlightning, bearing tidings of good and evil.” Historian John Brooks described the impact of the\ntelephone on life in the first decade of the 1900s this way: “In city and country alike, the\ntelephone was creating a new habit of mind—a habit of tenseness and alertness, of demanding\nand expecting immediate results, whether in business, love or other forms of social interaction.”\nThe First Call Centers\nIn the early 1900s, fast-growing demand in transportation and communication services was\ncreating new challenges. Whether it was roads, rails, runways or relay circuits, the pressure was\non to get capacity in place. And business leaders struggled to understand how these new\ncapabilities would change customer behavior. As the subscriber base grew, telephone companies were contending with a perplexing\nresource-planning problem. Human operators were required to establish connections for\ncustomers, as automated “central offices” hadn’t yet been invented. The big question was, how\nmany operators were needed? Too few, and long waits would be unacceptable to customers. But\ntoo many would be inefficient and drive up costs. Further complicating the issue, the calls came in randomly, driven by the myriad of\nmotivations individuals had for placing calls. It was one thing to get physical infrastructure in\nplace. But it was a different challenge altogether to get ever-changing calling demand and\npatterns accurately matched up with the correct number of human operators—day in and day out. Service that was slow or unavailable was unacceptable to a public that had thoroughly embraced\nthis new means of communication. In the years that followed, many bright people would grapple with these and related resource\nmanagement challenges. One of the first was A.K. Erlang, an engineer with the Copenhagen\nTelephone Company in Denmark."

We see significant breakthroughs, from social networks that\nconnect us in new and powerful ways to multimedia capabilities that can instantly put us face-to-\nface. What Brookes described in the early 1900s is as true as ever: communications capabilities\nhave us “demanding and expecting immediate results.”\nAnd if you manage a modern contact center, there is a familiar ring to the demands the early\ntelephone switchboards faced.

Let’s take a look at each.\nContact center management is the art of having the right number of properly skilled\npeople and supporting resources in place at the right times to handle an accurately\nforecasted workload, at service level and with quality.\nThe Right Resources in Place at the Right Times\nTo deliver consistently high levels of service, you need a strategy that defines how you will\ninteract with customers. We’ll look at the importance of developing and maintaining an effective\n“customer access strategy” in Chapter 2. Then, you will need a systematic planning and\nmanagement process, which can be summarized in nine steps:"
  },
  {
    "page_number": 18,
    "text": "1. CHOOSE SERVICE LEVEL AND RESPONSE TIME OBJECTIVES. These\nfundamental objectives set parameters for the two major types of interactions: those that must be\nhandled right away (requiring a service level objective) and those that can be handled at a later\ntime (requiring a response time objective). We’ll explore these objectives in Chapter 4.\n2. COLLECT DATA. Today’s contact center systems are important sources of planning\ndata. But much of the information you need comes from beyond the contact center: what\nmarketing is doing, how customer preferences are changing, competitive activity that may have\nan impact on workload, developments in the economy, and so on. We’ll discuss this step in\nChapter 5.\n3. FORECAST THE WORKLOAD. A good forecast accurately predicts the number and\nnature of contacts and expected handling times for future time periods. Forecasts should\nencompass all channels—phone, email, chat, social media, video, text, and others. Your plans\nshould also account for any related work that will require contact center resources. We’ll discuss\nforecasting in Chapter 6.\n4. CALCULATE BASE STAFF. Most contact centers use the formula Erlang C or\nvariations of it to calculate staffing requirements. But capabilities such as skills-based routing\nand complex network environments present variables that may require computer simulation and\nmodeling. We’ll explore these issues in Chapter 7.\n5.

Once you’ve estimated staffing requirements for customer\nworkloads, you’ve also got to be realistic about other demands on time—breaks, training, work\nnot directly part of handling customer interactions, absenteeism, and others. We’ll take a look at\nthis step in Chapter 8.\n7. ORGANIZE SCHEDULES. Schedules are plans that specify who needs to be where and\nwhen. They should result in getting the right people in the right places at the right times. We will\ndiscuss scheduling in Chapter 8.\n8. CALCULATE COSTS. This step projects costs for the resources required to meet service\nand quality objectives. We’ll cover budget issues throughout Parts Two, Three and Four.\n9. REPEAT FOR HIGHER AND LOWER LEVELS OF SERVICE. Preparing budgets\naround different levels of service provides an understanding of cost trade-offs, which is of great\nvalue in budgeting decisions. We will discuss this step in Chapter 10.\nWithout exception, the best-managed contact centers do a good job of resource planning and\nmanagement. They have established processes that are collaborative and accurate. But of course,\nmeeting service level objectives is just an enabler—a ticket to proceed. The real value comes\nfrom what you do with interactions once the connections are made.\nDoing the Right Things—Creating Value\nDoing the right things means creating value for your customers and organization. Contact\ncenters have the potential to create value on three levels:\nLEVEL 1: EFFICIENCY. Because contact centers combine or “pool” resources—people,\ninformation, and technology—they can deliver services that require the involvement of agents\nvery efficiently. Effective forecasting, scheduling, and real-time management contribute to these\ninherent efficiencies. We’ll look at these subjects in Parts Two and Three.\nLEVEL 2: CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND LOYALTY. Research reveals a\npowerful connection between high levels of customer satisfaction and business results—market\nshare, word of mouth, profitability, and others. Customers can easily share experiences through\nratings and (as we all know) social media—any interaction can impact the reputation of the\norganization and its products and services."

In the course of handling interactions, the contact center\ncan become a powerful source of insight (from customers, agents, and operational data), enabling\nthe broader organization to improve products, services, and the overall customer experience.\nThis involves virtually every other functional area.\nSome organizations have discovered the true strategic potential of their contact center, and\nothers are just beginning this discovery process. Creating more value often requires you to\nrethink priorities, goals and objectives, metrics, job roles, processes, how you use technologies,\nand other aspects of your approach. Most importantly, it involves working closely with the rest\nof the organization (see figure)—creating a great customer experience is a team sport!

Let’s say you want to\ninteract with your customers through social media—Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, or\nothers. The same planning and management steps apply.

On the other hand, you might have thousands of employees working across multiple\nsites. In either case—or any point in-between—you need a plan to guide the direction and\ndevelopment of your contact center.\nIn contact center terminology, a strategic plan is known as a customer access strategy. In this\nchapter, we’ll identify the customer expectations on which your strategy should be based. We’ll\nthen turn to what a customer access strategy is, identify the components that make up an\neffective strategy, and look at some of the creative ways organizations are engaging with their\ncustomers.\nBut before we explore those topics, let’s answer the most basic question: What is a contact\ncenter?\nWhat Is a Contact Center?\nA prerequisite to developing an effective strategy is to decide that you need a contact center\n—or perhaps acknowledge that you already have one! Let’s review what a contact center is and\ndoes, and identify characteristics that define all contact centers.\nICMI defines contact center as: “a coordinated system of people, processes, technologies and\nstrategies that provides access to information, resources and expertise, through appropriate\nchannels of communication, enabling interactions that create value for the customer and\norganization.” Okay, there’s a bit to this definition. But there’s also a bit (actually a lot) to\ncontact centers—much more than casual observers may know.\nIt’s often easier to explain what a contact center does than to define it. And great\nexamples are everywhere.\nConsider healthcare. In recent years, many hospital systems have launched contact centers. In\ntheir simplest form, they help patients reach the right department, doctor’s office, or patient\nroom. However, the more advanced centers—the kind I’m referring to here—provide a wide\nrange of services, including medical advice lines, billing and insurance issues, physician\nreferrals, even information and registration on wellness classes. All through this one resource."

    "text": "It’s often easier to explain what a contact center does than to define it. And great examples\nare everywhere.\nYou can imagine the rationale these management teams think through before launch:\nCustomers (patients) have thousands of questions a day. They contact different departments\nlooking for answers, often reaching the wrong places. The employees in those areas don’t have\nthe time, training, or know-how to handle many of the misdirected inquiries that they get. In\nmany cases, those handling contacts aren’t sure where to send patients for the information they\nneed, so they transfer them to other units or back to a main switchboard. This dance wastes\ncountless hours and frustrates everyone, employees and customers alike.\nThen someone begins to ponder. “What if we had a better way to handle all of these issues?\nWe could train qualified professionals and give them access to the information they need. We’ll\nhire nurses to address medical-related questions. And we’ll put in a system for documenting\ncontacts and logging critical data. We’ll develop quality processes for coordinating with the rest\nof the institution and safeguarding information.” One day … voilà, a contact center is born!\nThis whole sequence of events—beginning with someone envisioning a better way to serve\ncustomers—has played itself out many times in recent decades. All of today’s best contact\ncenters started as an idea. Today, contact centers are part of every vertical sector of the economy,\nincluding commercial, government, and nonprofit. They can be found in organizations of all\ntypes, small and large.\nThis discovery process can also happen within organizations that already have contact\ncenters. For example, the marketing department may respond to customer service issues that\nshow up in social media channels. But keeping up becomes increasingly difficult, and a constant\ndistraction from other work. Service to customers becomes hit-or-miss. The wise among them\nget together with their colleagues in customer service and come up with a plan to enfold these\ninteractions into the contact center. They’ll let go of the work but establish good cross-functional\ncollaboration with the contact center to ensure customers are being served well.\nCharacteristics of Contact Centers\nAll contact centers, small or large, share some basic characteristics. These include:\n▪ Interactions are handled by a group of employees, not a specific person. (In other words,\ncustomers reach out to a service, not an individual.)\n▪ Agents are cross-trained to handle a variety of contact types.\n▪ Customer contacts are distributed based on agent availability and/or specific skills required.\n▪ Agents have access to information on the organization’s products, services, policies, and any\nother resources needed.\n▪ Agents are empowered to make decisions and take actions for customers."

It’s a bit chaotic. Okay, very chaotic. But they and their teams\ndo their best to manage variable workloads and meet customer needs.\nOne fortunate day, they’ll run across a blog or be talking with a colleague. They will discover\nthat contact center management is a profession. They may do some further digging and discover\na bunch of resources that can help. They will find articles, conferences, and other professionals\nwho also manage contact centers. They will realize—with great relief and excitement—they are\nnot alone! If this describes you, and you’ve only recently discovered contact center management\n—welcome!\nWhat Should You Call Your Contact Center? Your Employees?\nWhile the term “call center” is still commonly used outside the industry and in mainstream\npublications, it has largely fallen out of favor with those in the profession. As organizations\ncontinue to transition centers once dominated by calls and email into omnichannel operations\nincorporating chat, text, video, social media, and other types of contacts, many feel that “contact\ncenter” (spelled “contact centre” in much of the English-speaking world) just makes more sense.\nAnd that is the term I use throughout this book. But you’ll find other variants, including:\n▪ Customer care\n▪ Support center\n▪ Resource center\n▪ Customer service center\n▪ Customer experience team\n▪ Sales and support\n▪ Technical support\n▪ Help desk\n▪ Information line\n▪ And others\nThere are also terms specific to some industries, such as reservations center (travel), hotline\n(emergency services), and trading desk (financial services). And some organizations create their\nown terms, like the “Customer Loyalty Team” for online retailer Zappos, or “AppleCare” for the\ncomputer company."

    "text": "Similarly, there are many terms for contact center employees: agents, customer service\nrepresentatives (CSRs), customer care representatives, associates, consultants, engineers, and\nothers. Some organizations refer to their contact center employees as customer advocates. (I like\nit!)\nMy advice is to use terms that fit your organization’s personality. How you refer to your\noperation and employees can make a difference. These labels become part of your team’s brand\n—they influence how colleagues and customers see you. So go for something inspirational!\nCustomer Expectations\nContact centers are all about enabling organizations to meet customer expectations—to be\nthere when needed and with the services needed. But wait … aren’t expectations always\nchanging?\nYes and no. Customer demands are constantly evolving because improvements in service\nreset their expectations at new levels. While customers initially appreciate good service, they\nquickly get used to and expect it. Additionally, the experiences customers have with any\norganization—not just yours or your competitors’—help shape their perceptions. So,\norganizations that are driving service innovations are upping the ante for all others.\nThe good news is, zeroing in on customer expectations is not the hit-or-miss proposition it\nmay appear to be. ICMI has researched this issue for nearly three decades and has found ten\ncustomer expectations that consistently emerge.\n✽✽✽\nTen Key Customer Expectations\n(no specific order)\n1. Be accessible\n2. Treat me courteously\n3. Be responsive to what I need and want\n4. Do what needs to be done promptly\n5. Provide well-trained and informed employees\n6. Tell me what to expect\n7.

    "text": "10. Be socially responsible and ethical\n✽✽✽\nThe key is to keep tabs of what these expectations mean to customers. For example, there\nwas a time when being accessible simply meant having a call center, a toll-free number, and\nreasonably well-trained agents. Today, there are many access alternatives, and customers expect\nto reach you easily and intuitively (they don’t want to think about channels). Customers expect\nservice that is easy to use and consistent across all touchpoints. While courtesy used to refer primarily to the way agents interact with customers, the\ndefinition today is much more ingrained in systems and processes. Don’t make customers repeat\nthe same information or reexplain the background of an existing service issue. Don’t transfer\nthem around or place them on hold for too long. And put your contact information where\ncustomers can easily find it. Sure, it’s as important as ever that your agents are courteous—but\nthere’s a lot more to it. Definitions of responsiveness and promptness are also evolving. As one example, email\nresponse times have gotten far better in recent years—from several days to a matter of hours in\nmany organizations (see Chapter 4). In fact, some organizations are staffing for email like they\ndo calls or chat and handling them as they arrive. Similarly, more organizations all the time are\nhandling time-sensitive social media interactions as they occur. Another customer expectation is that the organization will staff the contact center with well-\ntrained and knowledgeable agents. As a rule, contact centers are handling more complex issues,\nthrough more channels and from customers that come from increasingly diverse backgrounds. Robust self-service capabilities are handling a deeper range of issues, leaving your employees\nwith the most complex interactions. Successful contact centers are rethinking and upgrading\nrecruiting and hiring practices, the training they provide to agents and managers, and the tools\nand processes they put in place. Tell me what to expect. Meet your commitments and keep your promises. Do it right the first\ntime. Follow up. These expectations are interrelated and require that people, processes, and\ntechnologies work together. The promises your organization or employees make must also be\nbacked up by other departments. Customers live by the mantra “trust but verify”—they’ll trust\nyour organization if you hold up your end of the bargain. Be socially responsible and ethical. Lapses, or even perceived lapses, in ethics or social\nresponsibility quickly make the rounds with customers and your own employees. Ethics and\nresponsibility are the concern of the entire organization, but as a hub of communication, the\ncontact center is inherently involved. In short, anticipating customer expectations is essential to developing effective services. In\nfact, customer expectations ultimately define what good service means."

    "text": "▪ Don’t guess at how you’re doing. Track customer perceptions through social media\nchannels, during interactions with agents, and through surveys that provide input on how well\nyou’re living up to their expectations.\n▪ That said, remember the late Steve Jobs’ advice: customers don’t usually know what they\nwant until you show it to them. If you want to differentiate through service, don’t just copy\nindustry “best practices”—be bold and create services that are appropriate for your organization\nand brand.\n▪ Finally, ensure that customer expectations form the context in which you develop your\ncustomer access strategy—the topic we’ll turn to next.\nShaping Your Strategy\nAt some point in developing customer services, the need for an overall plan becomes very\nobvious. So many decisions—do you add this channel, do you support that service, and many\nothers—are interrelated.\nYou need an effective strategy. Otherwise, you’ll be winging it—and wasting lots of time\nand resources.\nVision\nI recommend beginning with your vision—where do you want to go? A customer service\nvision helps define the type of service you want your organization to deliver.\nA common mistake I see, and one you’ll want to avoid, is coming up with an overly-\ngeneralized vision or mission. For example, “we put customers first,” or “we deliver world-class\nservice” are so generic and uninspiring that they really don’t help much in guiding decisions.\nVision can be represented as a vision statement, a mission statement, a set of values, or some\noverarching principles or standards. I love outdoor equipment and services retailer REI’s\nmission, which also serves as its customer service vision: “We inspire, educate and outfit for a\nlifetime of outdoor adventure and stewardship.” What great direction this short statement\nprovides, even to the newest employees!\nUSAA, the highly-rated insurance and financial company, operates around four core values\n(which are really just four words): Service. Loyalty. Honesty. Integrity. Together, they are\nsimple, clear, and inspiring. And they pack a punch because at USAA they discuss and include\nthem in decisions every day. That makes a real difference.\nIf your organization has a vision that is too generic or that doesn’t help guide those delivering\nservice, you may want to create one that’s specific to your contact center. Just make sure it’s\ncomplementary, cautions consultant Todd Gladden, part of an ICMI team that advises\norganizations on their strategies. “Have a ‘line of sight’ linkage between the contact center’s\nvision and strategy and how they support the overall vision and strategy of the company. The tie-\nin should be clear—and will prevent conflicting agendas as tactics are implemented.”"

Come up with something that both inspires and recognizes\nthe enormous potential of your organization and contact center. Components of a Customer Access Strategy\nA customer access strategy is “a framework—a set of standards, guidelines and processes—\ndescribing the means by which customers and the organization can interact and are enabled to\naccess the information, services and expertise needed.” It is the overall plan—the blueprint—that\nguides the development of your contact center. A customer access strategy is a framework—a set of standards, guidelines, and\nprocesses—describing the means by which customers and the organization can interact and\nare enabled to access the information, services and expertise needed. As with an organization’s overall strategy, a customer access strategy can take many\ndifferent forms. But effective plans cover, in one way or another, these essential components. CUSTOMERS: This part of your strategy should summarize how customers are segmented\n(e.g., by geography, volume of business, level of service purchased, unique requirements, or\nother characteristics) so that you can shape specific services that are just right. Customer\nsegmentation typically comes from the organization’s marketing strategy. However, given the\noperational requirements of serving different customers appropriately, I’ve noticed that contact\ncenter managers are increasingly involved in this effort. CONTACT TYPES: This step identifies the major types of interactions that will occur (e.g.,\ninquiries, orders, support). Think through how each type of interaction could improve customer\nloyalty and build value. For example, some you’ll work to eliminate (through improved products\nand services), some you’ll want to automate through self-service, and some will best be served\nwith the involvement of an agent. ACCESS ALTERNATIVES: This step—where strategy really begins to hit home for\ncontact centers—identifies all of the possible communication channels (phone, chat, email, social\nmedia, text, video, face-to-face, self-service, customer communities … the lot) along with\ncorresponding telephone numbers, web addresses, email addresses, social media usernames, IVR\nmenus, physical addresses, etc. Where more than one channel is involved in an interaction (say,\nwhen a customer begins in an app and has a conversation with an agent) define as many possible\ncombinations as you can. HOURS OF OPERATION: This part of your strategy defines appropriate hours of\noperation. These can vary for different contact channels or types of interactions. Generally, self-\nservice applications will always be available. Some agent-assisted services may be available\n24/7, while others may have more limited hours."

Different objectives\nmay be appropriate for different types of interactions, contact channels, and customer segments. ROUTING METHODOLOGY: This part of the plan covers how—by customer, type of\ninteraction and access channel—each contact is going to be routed and distributed. While these\nterms have inbound connotations, this also applies to outbound; for example, when the\norganization originates the contact, through which agent group will the contact be made? PEOPLE/TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES REQUIRED: This step transitions from\n“getting the contact to the right place at the right time” to “doing the right things.” Which agents\nor systems will be required for each customer segment and contact type? INFORMATION REQUIRED: What information on customers, products, services, and\npolicies will need to be accessible to agents and customers? What information should be\ncaptured during interactions? How will the organization meet applicable privacy or reporting\nrequirements? ANALYSIS/IMPROVEMENT: This step defines how the information captured or created\nduring contacts will be used to better understand customers and to improve products, services,\nand processes. You may also want to summarize major performance objectives and how the\ncontact center’s value and contributions will be measured (see Chapter 12). GUIDELINES FOR DEPLOYING NEW SERVICES: Finally, your plan should outline a\nframework for deploying new services, including technology architecture (corporate standards\nand technology migration plans) and investment guidelines (priorities for operational and capital\nexpenditures). This step should also describe who will keep the customer access strategy current\nas services evolve: who has overall responsibility, how often the plan will be updated, and who\nhas ownership of individual components. What Does a Customer Access Strategy Look Like? Customer access strategies are like business plans in that some are well-documented and\nothers exist only in pieces and in the heads of various managers. Too often, the latter is the case. But there are standout examples of plans that are effective and up-to-date. A mobile phone company that I have worked with has a well-organized customer access\nstrategy, which lives on the organization’s private intranet. It consists of a cleanly designed home\npage, the centerpiece, which provides links to each of the individual components. The links\naccess files (databases, documents, etc.) that make up the different parts of their plan, such as\ncustomer segments, access numbers and addresses, routing diagrams, agent groups, hours of\noperation, service level objectives (and so forth). There are also links within these areas that\nallow you to logically move to others—but the home page will always get you back to the main\ndirectory."

The plan is current, and they don’t make major decisions\nwithout referring to it.\nQuestions Your Customer Access Strategy Will Answer\nYour customer access strategy will be a guide that you can use to answer many important\nquestions. For example:\n▪ How should your contact center be organized (e.g., how agent groups should be\nstructured)?\n▪ If you add or improve integration of an access channel, what is the impact on other\ncomponents and resources?\n▪ What kinds of skills and knowledge will your agents, supervisors and managers need? How\nshould your hiring and training practices support these requirements?\n▪ What system capabilities best support your strategy? Do you have what you need in-house\nor will you need to build, buy, or contract for required technologies?\n▪ What kind of processes best support your plans? Where should they be refined or\nrestructured?\n▪ Is it feasible or advisable to outsource some or all of your contact center services? (If so, the\ncustomer access strategy is still the responsibility of the client organization.) What capabilities\nmust the outsourcer have to support your requirements?\n▪ Can contact center strategy help shape the organization’s strategy (e.g., by helping to\ndifferentiate the organization’s services)? Are the organization’s overall strategy, contact center\nstrategy, and the realities of budgets and resources in alignment?\nWith new ways to communicate and connect emerging by the day, the sky is the limit! As\nyou make decisions, keep your customers’ needs and perspectives front and center. Customers\ndon’t think of contact channels or departments. You don’t hear a customer say, “I’m going to\ncontact XYZ’s contact center.” They say, “I’m going to contact XYZ.” To them, the contact\ncenter is the company. The best managed organizations know this, and they cultivate strategies\nthat enable their brands to shine through.\n✽✽✽\n\"Playbook\" at the University of California\nDoes a customer access strategy sound like something that would be nice to have? Actually, it’s vital. Just ask anyone who’s\npart of the University of California’s Retirement Administration Service Center (UC RASC).\nThe University of California is the world’s leading public research university system, with ten campuses, five medical\ncenters, three national labs and a network of researchers and educators.

It has become a tool that all of us within the RASC use and reference. It gives the team a strategic view of why we\ndo what we do—a view that doesn’t get lost in day-to-day activities.” Many RASC employees provided input into shaping the\ncustomer access strategy, which the team now refers to as the “Playbook.”\nThe Playbook has brought many benefits: better focus on priorities; teams that are increasingly self-directed; and projects\nthat come in on time and within budget. It even helps RASC employees envision and develop their careers.\nAnd the most exciting benefit? The University of California uses the RASC as an enticement to attract some of the best\nprofessors, doctors, researchers and specialized talent available in the global market. “Our customer access strategy has helped\nour contact center become a strategic asset,” says Lorenz.\n✽✽✽\nMake It Yours!\nWhat access channels should be opened up? What’s the nature of service you intend to\nprovide? Beyond applying the sound management principles we’ll be looking at throughout the\nbook, these decisions are yours to make. My overarching advice: Make your customer access\nstrategy uniquely yours—do what’s best for your customers and your organization.\nHere are some examples of how customer access strategies are playing out:\n▪ London-based Barclays bank offers video banking, allowing customers to chat face-to-face\nwith a representative from their smart phone or tablet. The service is available 24/7, and offers\nsupport on a wide range of services.\n▪ 1-800-Flowers (1800flowers.com) is the company name, phone number, primary URL, and\n(you guessed it) address for Twitter, Facebook, and other channels.\n▪ Discover Card enables customers to reach agents through in-app messaging, among other\nchannels. Unlike conventional chat, which requires customers to stay connected until a problem\nis resolved, customers can respond to agents when they choose without having to start over on an\nissue.\n▪ Dyson puts its toll-free number and website address right on its vacuum cleaner handles—\nclearly visible to anyone who uses the appliance.\n▪ Intuit’s Accounting Professional Division developed a vibrant customer community, easily\naccessible directly through their accounting software programs; users help each other with most\nquestions, and contact center agents have become facilitators and problems solvers for issues\nrequiring the company’s involvement.\n▪ The National Cancer Institute in the U.S. uses Facebook Live Events to reach out to patients\nand their families with information and support."

Observe the organizations you most enjoy doing business with, and\nyou’ll notice the best deliver services in ways that meet customer needs while complementing\ntheir own brands and cultures.\nGiven the many ways to interact, a smart practice is to create an easy-to-find online listing of\naccess alternatives. Do a search on “how to contact [Schwab, KLM, Apple]” and you’ll see good\nexamples of the primary ways to reach the organization. From landing pages that list contact\nalternatives, some organizations provide templates for entering product numbers, serial numbers\nor customer information that leads to more accurate routing and customized services.\nStudies show that when problems get serious, customers (yes, of all generations)\noverwhelmingly want to interact with a human. Companies that make their contact information\nhard to find (usually in an attempt to minimize costs) are asking for trouble. A search will\nusually pull up other sources—blogs, customer communities, and sites such as GetHuman.com—\nthat provide tips for reaching the organization. These can include contact numbers, advice on\nnavigating difficult menus or (when the company is perceived to be purposely hard to reach)\ndirect contact numbers for executives or administrative offices.\nHere’s a final recommendation: Be sure to provide an acceptable basic level of service\n(through good resource planning, a topic of later chapters) across all of your access channels.\nThe best plans go awry when customers get frustrated and begin intentionally selecting the\nwrong menu choices or using access alternatives for other services, just to reach a person.\nClearly, developing an effective customer access strategy is not something you throw\ntogether during an afternoon team brainstorm (though that can certainly give the creative part a\npush!). It takes leadership, persistence, and participation from across the organization.\nBut the payoffs are huge. From a customer’s perspective, a good strategy will result in\nsimplified access, more consistent services, and a high degree of convenience. From the\norganization’s perspective, the benefits translate into better decisions, services that are more\neffective and efficient, and a dependable framework to guide developments.\n✽✽✽\nPoints to Remember"

MACPHERSON, JR.\nN\newcomers to contact centers are often surprised at how different they are compared with\nother departments or types of “office” work.\n“The workload is volatile.”\n“Timing is so critical.”\n“Things change so quickly!”\nThose who have never been in a contact center and see this dynamic for the first time—calls\nentering the queue, the back-and-forth of chat, social media messages lighting up screens, et al.\n—are often astounded at how fast-moving the environment is.\nYep, the workload does change from moment to moment. And when customers don’t know\nhow long the queue (their wait time) is, they become impatient much more quickly than in\nsettings where they can see what’s going on.\nThe vast majority of contact centers handle primarily “inbound” contacts—those initiated by\ncustomers. There are three major driving forces at work in any center that handles inbound\nworkload:\n1. Workload arrival—random, smooth, or peaked?\n2. The queue—visible or invisible?\n3. The seven factors of customer tolerance\nThese driving forces help explain why the contact center environment is unique.\nUnderstanding them is necessary for making good decisions on everything from staffing and\nscheduling requirements to establishing the right performance objectives.\nWorkload Arrival—Random, Smooth, or Peaked?\nThe first driving force in contact centers is how workload arrives. If you’ve spent more than\njust a few minutes in a contact center, you’ve probably already discovered a dominant reality:\ncontacts come in as they please. They certainly do not arrive in anything resembling an even,\norderly flow."

    "text": "Random Arrival\nCustomer contacts arrive randomly in most contact centers most of the time. Take a look at a\nmonitor or a readerboard (display mounted on a wall or the ceiling, showing information on the\nqueue). Watch the dynamics. In comes a contact. Then one, two more … there’s another. And\ntwo, three, four more … Exactly when contacts arrive from moment to moment is the result of\ndecisions made by customers who are motivated by myriad individual needs and conditions. Put\nanother way, contacts bunch up!\nThe figure illustrates two possible scenarios of how 50 customer contacts might arrive. The\ninput for the chart came from a statistical table of random numbers.\nHowever, there is an important distinction between random contact arrival and predictable\narrival patterns. Virtually all contact centers—even those of the more volatile type, such as\nemergency services—have distinctive patterns in customer contacts, which are usually detectable\ndown to at least the half-hour timeframe. You can predict that you will get around 250 contacts\nnext Tuesday between 11 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. What you can’t predict with any precision is how\nmany of those contacts are going to arrive at 11:01, 11:02, 11:03, and so forth.\nConsider another example. If you manage an ice cream stand, you can (with some analysis\nand practice) predict the number of customers and sales based on month of year, day of week,\nand time of day. Saturday afternoons during warm months will be busy, but traffic will be light\non mid-week autumn mornings. You can also predict the volume before and after promotions or"

First, staffing must be\ncalculated by using either a queuing formula that takes random arrival into account or a computer\nsimulation program that accurately models this phenomenon (see Chapter 7). Other approaches\nalmost always lead to inaccurate staffing calculations. And unfortunately, it’s not just staffing\nthat will be off. Because staffing affects the “load” your network and systems must carry,\ninaccurate staff predictions also lead to miscalculations of these other resources.\nSecond, centers that handle inbound contacts operate in a “demand-chasing” environment. At\nany given time, there are either more contacts than staff to handle them or more staff than\ncontacts to be handled. That means contact centers must pair good forecasting and staffing plans\nwith effective real-time management (Chapter 11). You don’t want to overreact to normal ebb\nand flow in workload—but you need to be able to respond quickly if a serious resource mismatch\nis developing.\nThird, performance objectives and standards must take random workload arrival into\naccount. For example, a goal of producing “N widgets per day” makes no sense in an\nenvironment where the workload arrives randomly (see Chapter 14). Unless the queue is always\nbacked up and service is lousy, your agents will spend a portion of their day waiting for contacts\nto arrive.\nSmooth and Peaked Traffic\nIn addition to random or “normal” traffic, there are two other general types of workload:\n“smooth” and “peaked.” Traffic engineers have assigned statistical “variance-to-mean” ratios to\ndesignate each type of traffic, but essentially, the patterns for each look like those in the figure,\nThree Types of Workload Arrival.\nSmooth traffic is virtually nonexistent in centers handling incoming contacts, but it can apply"

For example, a group of people may be assigned to make outbound\ncalls (e.g., for surveys, sales initiatives, non-profit donations), one after another, for the duration\nof their shift. In that case, staffing requirements can be based on a units-of-output approach\ncommon in many manufacturing and service settings. Another type of contact arrival—peaked traffic—is a reality in some centers. Many of us use\nthe term “peak” in a general sense when referring to contact center workload: What’s your peak\ntime of year? Peak day of the week? Peak time of day? But the term “peaked traffic” specifically\nrefers to a surge of traffic beyond random variation. It is a spike within a short period of time. Television and radio ads often generate peaked traffic. For example, QVC (part of Qurate\nRetail Group) gets a surge of contacts when new products are advertised on its home-shopping\nchannel. Disaster relief and humanitarian organizations, such as the Red Cross and World\nVision, get peaked traffic when their ads are aired, as do mobile phone providers when they send\ntext messages to a large portion of their subscribers. Even email promotions sent in batches can\ngenerate an initial surge of contacts (as well as contacts that will arrive in subsequent hours and\ndays). The (typically) large centers that handle peaked traffic can go from receiving zero to\nhundreds of contacts per minute, almost instantly. (Seeing this dynamic will immediately boost\nyour heart rate!)\nIt’s important to distinguish between random and peaked traffic. When retailers send out\nthousands of new catalogs by mail, they begin getting contacts (calls, chat, etc.) associated with\nthe promotion. But that’s not peaked workload arrival. It’s random arrival, just at a much higher\nlevel than usual. Similarly, a utility that has a power outage will receive a lot of contacts until the\nproblem is fixed. But other than the few minutes following the outage (which is a time of peaked\ntraffic) those contacts will arrive randomly, although at a level much higher than usual. The key\npoint to consider: if a surge of contacts lasts longer than 30 minutes, for staffing purposes it’s\nconsidered random workload arrival. Randomly Arriving Peaked Traffic\nSome centers experience workload arrival that is a hybrid between random and peaked\ntraffic. Emergency service centers often get a surge of calls reporting the same traffic accident. A\ntopic that trends in social media can quickly generate contacts. And in an unusual example, I was\nfacilitating a seminar for a financial company one afternoon when their calls went through the\nroof—as it turns out, talk show host Oprah Winfrey had just interviewed a guest who encouraged\nviewers to negotiate interest rates with their credit card companies. These are examples of\npeaked traffic that show up without notice (as opposed to the kind you can predict, such as when\nyou run a TV ad)."

Increments, also called\nintervals, are the smallest units of time reflected in reports and used for resource planning.\nTypical reporting increments include:\n30 MINUTES. Thirty-minute increments are common because they provide an adequate\nlevel of detail and accuracy for many centers without burying them in unnecessary detail.\n15 MINUTES. Large contact centers (e.g., those exceeding 100 agents in an agent group)\npick up additional accuracy by planning around 15-minute increments.\n60 MINUTES. Contact centers that handle long calls (e.g., when the average length of\ninteractions exceeds 20 minutes) can establish report increments and staff calculations around\nhour increments.\n10 MINUTES OR LESS. Peaked traffic—the kind you can anticipate and manage, such as a\ntelevision ad—requires reports and staffing calculations at 5- or 10-minute increments.\nThe principle here is to forecast and plan down to the smallest increment within which you\ncan no longer detect patterns. For many, that is 30 minutes and that’s the increment I recommend\nfor most contact centers. If you’re a large contact center (e.g., into the hundreds of agents), you'll\npick up needed accuracy with 15-minute intervals. If you’re small (a dozen or fewer agents) or\nhave long calls with average handling times that exceed 20 minutes, hour increments often work\nbest.\nBuilding Understanding\nIt’s important that others across your organization understand the nature of random workload\narrival. And nothing helps more than seeing it firsthand.\nAs customers, we’ve all experienced the fragile balance between resources and demand—\nexpressways that ebb and flow, airports that struggle to stay on schedule as bad weather moves\nthrough, the immediate and pleasant impact on lines when a busy supermarket opens more\ncheckout registers. But seeing this dynamic in a contact center is an eye-opening experience!\nUsually, colleagues from other areas will quickly grasp the importance of good cross-\nfunctional communication, keeping systems humming, and ensuring that the contact center has\nthe staff and support it needs. More importantly, a deeper appreciation of randomly arriving\nworkloads begins to take hold. This is not an assembly line or a stack of documents to process.\nYou cannot slow it down or speed it up. You’ve got to be there as the workload arrives! (See the\ndiscussion, The Power of One, Chapter 9).\nThe Queue—Visible or Invisible?\nThe second driving force in contact centers is the queue—is it visible or invisible to\ncustomers?

After all, handling every contact at once is\nabout as practical as it would be for airlines to check in every passenger’s luggage at the same\ntime. But an important difference between a contact center and the lines at an airline counter,\ngrocery store or sports arena is that customers usually can’t see how long the queue is and the\nprogress they are making.\nThe top row of faces in the figure reflects a queue that customers can see. The first face\nrepresents how people feel as they enter the queue. As they move forward, the subsequent faces\nillustrate their progress. The final face reflects the fact that they “made it”—they are at the front\nof the line, hearing the sweet words, “How may I help you?”\nThe second row of faces represents a setting where customers are unaware of the length of\nthe queue they are entering. Ignorance is bliss, and expectations are initially high. But after some\namount of waiting, often 15 or 20 seconds, they begin to doubt that they are going to get right\nthrough (second face). The third face illustrates the transition from doubt to mild frustration. By\nnow, they have heard the first and maybe second delay announcement and they know they are in\na queue.\nThe fourth face represents customers who, from their perspective, have waited too long.\nOften, the first thing they do when they reach an agent is tell him or her about the miserable\nexperience they just had. That’s a bad situation because it lengthens handling time, which will\nback up the queue even more and cause even more customers to complain to agents—a\ndownward spiral.\nAnd there’s another phenomenon that kicks in here. Customers who have waited a long time\nin queue tend to “dig in their heels” as they attempt to squeeze all the value out of the interaction\nthat they can: “Um, I’d better go over a few other things while I have you.”"

    "text": "Visible Queue\nThere’s a fascinating history of organizations that pioneered ways to make wait times known\nto customers. Software company WordPerfect (now part of Corel Corporation) created the first\n“visible queue” (or more literally, “audible queue”) in the mid-1980s. They set up their system to\nenable live “queue jockeys” to make announcements of expected hold times to callers. They\ncould also play music and deliver announcements to keep callers entertained and informed while\nthey waited:\nThank you for calling WordPerfect. If you’re calling for assistance with Version 2, there are\nnine of you in queue, and if you just joined us, it looks like the wait is just over three minutes. If\nyou are calling for Version 3, there are 18 callers in queue. But we’ve got a few more support\nreps there this morning, and it looks like your wait will be about two minutes. Now, here’s Kenny\nG from his latest album…\nWordPerfect discovered that customers who abandon a visible queue do so at the beginning. Those who decide to wait generally do so until they reach an agent. Many contact center managers keep a diligent eye on how many customers abandon (give up\non a call, chat, or other type of contact). But when customers abandon is also an important\nconsideration. If they are abandoning early on because they are making an informed choice,\nthat’s much different than waiting for what seems like a long time in an invisible queue before\nabandoning in frustration. What the queue jockey never said, but what was implicit in the message, was something like:\nThanks for calling. If you’re going to abandon, would you kindly do so now, before you get\nfrustrated, drive up our costs and clog up the queue only to abandon anyway? Other software companies, including archrival Microsoft, soon followed WordPerfect’s lead. The feedback from customers was overwhelmingly positive. But having real-time, live queue\njockeys proved impractical for most organizations. So, automatic call distributors (ACDs) that\ncould “tell time” began to appear in the early 1990s. With this technology, the system can\nanalyze real-time variables, make predictions, and announce expected wait times to customers as\nthey arrive. Today’s virtual queue capabilities go a step further, giving customers the option to\nhang up and receive a callback when an agent becomes available, without losing their place in\nqueue—see discussion, Can You Eliminate The Wait for Customers? Estimated wait times are a great feature, but there’s a catch. These systems provide fairly\naccurate predictions in reasonably straightforward environments, especially for large agent\ngroups. However, if you are using any form of priority or skills-based routing, the system can\noutsmart itself. Some customers have found themselves actually moving backward in queue as\n“priority” calls arrive and are moved to the front of the queue."

And if there is much of a queue, customers increasingly\nexpect contact centers to announce or display wait times. The Seven Factors Affecting Customer Tolerance\nThe third driving force in contact centers is customer tolerance. There are seven factors that\naffect tolerance. They influence how long customers will wait in queue, how many will abandon,\nwhether they will try alternative channels, and how they feel about the overall experience (based\non the expectations they had). They include:\n1. DEGREE OF MOTIVATION. How important is the interaction to customers? What are\nthe consequences to them of not getting through? How badly do they need the product or\nservice? For example, customers experiencing a power outage will usually wait longer to reach\ntheir utility than those with billing questions. 2. AVAILABILITY OF SUBSTITUTES. Even though they are highly motivated to initiate\na contact, customers who encounter difficulties may abandon if they know of another way to get\nhelp. Self-service, communities found online, or even physically going to a retail location are\nexamples of substitutes. If customers are highly motivated and have no acceptable alternatives,\nthey will generally wait a long time in queue (and will retry if they get busy signals). Even\nthough they do not abandon, they still might be very unhappy about the experience. 3. COMPETITION’S SERVICE LEVEL. If it’s easier for customers to use competitive\nservices and if they have a tough time reaching you, they may go elsewhere. (You’ll need to\nconsider whether competition is available in a practical sense. For example, if you are a bank and\na customer has a problem with an online payment, a competitive bank is not going to be able to\nhelp—although if the problem is difficult to get resolved, the customer may decide to take their\nfuture business elsewhere.) It’s also important to consider that a contact center is often its own\ncompetition—customers may choose incorrect routing selections in the IVR or simultaneously\ntry other channels just to reach an agent…any agent…more quickly. This leads to transferred\ncontacts, inaccurate reports, longer handling times and other problems. 4. LEVEL OF EXPECTATIONS. The experiences customers have had with the contact\ncenter and the reputation that the organization has for service have a direct impact on tolerance. A 10-minute wait for tax help during filing season may be perceived as good service—but a\nsimilar wait for a shipping company that has a reputation for speedy service would be an\nunpleasant surprise. And, as discussed in Chapter 2, the services that customers receive from any\norganization, including those in other industries, have a bearing on their expectations. 5. TIME AVAILABLE. How much time do customers have when they initiate a contact?"

In the\nrare cases they don’t, a large percentage of customers will likely have calling plans that provide\nnationwide calling. But there’s a rub: If a customer’s plan is based on blocks of minutes, they\ncan get understandably upset if the time they purchased is wasted in queue. (Virtual queue\ncapabilities can help in this case—see discussion, Can You Eliminate the Wait for Customers?)\n7. HUMAN BEHAVIOR. The weather, the customer’s mood, and the day’s news all have\nsome bearing on customer tolerance.\nThese seven factors are not static. They are constantly changing. Even so, it’s important to\nhave a general understanding of the factors affecting your customers’ tolerance. Important\nquestions to consider include:\n▪ How motivated are your customers?\n▪ What are their expectations?\n▪ How do their expectations vary based on the reason for the contact?\n▪ What alternatives to contacting you do they have?\n▪ Which alternatives would you want/not want them to use?\n▪ Will they already have spent time seeking help (e.g., search or self-service)?\n▪ What level of service are others in the industry providing?\n▪ How do customers tend to rate your service at different service levels?\n▪ What is your customers’ tendency to share experiences, good or bad?\n▪ What level of service best reflects your brand?\nThinking through your customers’ situations and expectations will help you shape services\nthat meet their needs. This is not an exact science, but it’s very helpful to understand your\ncustomers’ perspectives as much as you can.\n✽✽✽\nA Classic Case Study in Customer Tolerance\nA one-of-a-kind campaign by British Airways provided a formative case study in customer tolerance. In 1997, to celebrate\nits 10th anniversary since privatization, British Airways launched an international phone promotion that drew tens of millions of\ncallers. The contest offered customers the chance to win virtually free tickets to fly round-trip on the Concorde, British Airway’s\nlegendary (and now retired) supersonic jet, if they were among the first 100 callers to reach the center once the promotion\nofficially began."

As expected, most callers who got the announcement kept trying to get through; those who reached the\nqueue were willing to wait and abandonment was negligible—hardly anyone hung up. Just 25 minutes after the contest began—\nand an astonishing 20 million call attempts later—the promotion was over.\n✽✽✽\nPutting Abandonment in Perspective\nIn many contact centers, abandonment rate is viewed as a key measure of how adequately the\ncenter is staffed. I often get questions like, “What’s an acceptable rate of abandonment? What is\nabandonment in such-and-such industry? What should our service level be to keep abandonment\nunder X percent?”\nThe usual assumptions are: a) there must be industry standards for abandonment; and b)\nabandonment is a good indicator of contact center performance. Neither is true.\nFor one thing, abandonment is tough to forecast accurately, at least on a consistent basis. To\ndo so would require predicting the impact of the seven factors of customer tolerance. But\nbecause the conditions that drive those factors are constantly changing, an almost unlimited\nnumber of variables can have an impact on abandonment.\nAnd keep in mind that abandonment can be a misleading measure of performance. The\nconventional wisdom is that longer queues translate into higher abandonment. But the seven\nfactors can help to explain apparent paradoxes:\n▪ Customers who are waiting may be simultaneously using alternatives to search for relevant\ninformation; abandonment could mean they found what they needed.\n▪ When financial markets swing significantly, companies in the financial sector get a surge of\ncontacts. Even though service level may drop, abandonment also often goes down because\ncustomers have a higher degree of motivation and are willing to wait longer.\n▪ When utilities or cable providers have network outages, customers (though not happy about\nit) are generally willing to wait longer than under normal circumstances. Service level may drop,\nbut abandonment will often be lower than usual.\nWhile these may be obvious examples, what about the more subtle day-to-day shifts in\ntolerance? It can be baffling. Sometimes, when people have to wait a long time, they wait. Other\ntimes, when service level is really good, abandonment is higher than expected.\n✽✽✽"

    "text": "Can You Eliminate the Wait?\nOne way to eliminate abandonment would be to eliminate the queue. Realistically, though, having every contact go\nimmediately to an agent is highly impractical. The reason is the law of diminishing returns: When agents are added, the\nimprovements in service level that can be attributed to each additional agent will eventually decline (see Chapter 9). The table\nbelow illustrates this phenomenon.\nVirtual queuing technologies enable customers to hang up and receive a return call without losing their place in queue. For\ncustomers, this prevents the need to leave a voicemail or to wait on hold. For agents, there’s little difference between an inbound\ncall and a callback—the system places outbound calls and delivers connected calls to agents, much like inbound calls.\nHow well this approach works depends on the willingness and availability of customers to take callbacks and the resource\ncapacity of the center to handle the calls. It can be especially useful in organizations influenced by weather, service outages and\nother factors beyond their control (travel, utilities, etc.). It’s not for every situation—if customers are not available when return\ncalls arrive, the ensuing message cycle can weigh heavily on resources and customer patience. You’ll also need to understand\nhow your system tracks and reports service level so that you’re interpreting it correctly."

Do you have the resources needed to support new products or services?\nService level ties the resources you need to the results you want to achieve.

Nothing can happen until you get contacts to where they are\nsupposed to go, so that they can be handled effectively.\nFor contacts that must be handled as they occur, service level as a measurement of\naccessibility is tried and true in centers worldwide.

    "text": "Service Level and Response Time Defined\nThe term service level is often used to refer to an organization’s overall responsiveness to\ncustomer contacts. But, when applied to resource calculations, service level has a specific\nexpression: “X percent of contacts answered within Y seconds\" (e.g., 90 percent of calls\nanswered within 20 seconds).\n“Answer” in this context means that the contact reached an agent so that he or she can begin\nto handle it. So, a call begins with the greeting; chat begins when the agent begins interacting\nwith the customer; a social media contact is “answered” when it reaches the agent and he or she\nbegins replying. (It’s always a good idea to find out how your system defines and treats service\nlevel and response time. There can be differences from one supplier to the next, and I always feel\nmore comfortable when I understand what’s going on.)\nThere are various alternative terms for service level. Service level is sometimes referred to as\ntelephone service factor, or TSF, which obviously sounds like it’s limited to phone calls. Some\ncall it grade of service (GOS), although I don’t prefer that term because it’s more typically used\nto quantify the degree of blocking on a group of trunks (see Chapter 7).

Response time can be referred to as speed of reply,\ntime to response, or even “service level” (not to be confused with the specific definition of\nservice level). Throughout the book, I will use response time in the specific sense described here,\nto refer to the level of service assigned to contacts that don’t have to be handled right away.\nDifferentiating between service level and response time is essential because base staff\ncalculations are different. Service level is used in situations with randomly arriving contacts and\nrequires Erlang C or computer simulation to determine staff requirements. Response time\ncontacts can be held for later processing and can rely on the traditional methods of staff planning\noften used outside of contact centers. (We’ll discuss these calculations in Chapter 7.)\nThere is a point at which response time objectives become service level objectives. For\nexample, some organizations have upped email response time objectives from 24 hours to within\nthe same hour. Some are going even further and handling email, social media contacts, and other\ncustomer interactions as they occur. For targets of less than an hour, service level (not response\ntime) becomes the defining objective.\n✽✽✽\nTwo Major Categories of Contacts\n▪ Those that must be handled as they occur.

For example, phone, video, or walk-in customers\nare service level interactions. Most customer email messages don’t have to be processed when\nthey arrive and are usually treated as response time interactions.\nBut what about interactions through social media? That depends.

When service\nlevel is appropriate, abandonment tends to take care of itself.\nService level also has a direct impact on channel hopping, which occurs when customers\nswitch to different access alternatives. If they encounter an extended wait, they might use self-\nservice alternatives, try different IVR menu selections (which is, technically, the same channel\nbut a different routing alternative), switch from chat to phone or vice versa, send a direct\nmessage to the company through a social channel, or throw up their hands and send a message to\nthe world (Have been waiting on hold for 20 minutes now to reach @XYZco. #Fail!). Or, they\nmight try simultaneous (parallel) contacts and see which generates a response first.\nDifferent customers have different experiences with your contact center, even if they are part\nof the same set of data measured by service level, ASA and other reports. Why? Random\nworkload arrival. Because of this reality, you will need an understanding of what happens to\ndifferent customers. At a high level, service level is the single best measure of these queue\nexperiences.\n✽✽✽\nAverage Speed of Answer Is Misleading\nAverage speed of answer (ASA) reflects the amount of time customers spend in queue, waiting to reach agents. It’s available\nfrom virtually any ACD. It’s widely used and reported—and it’s misleading.\nASA is mathematically sound, no problem there. The problem is in interpretation. Let’s say you expect 250 contacts in a\ngiven half hour and anticipate an average handling time of 3.5 minutes. If you want to achieve an ASA of between 10 and 15\nseconds, you’ll need 34 agents, which will produce an ASA of 12.7 seconds (these calculations are based on Erlang C, covered in\nChapter 7).\nBut the following illustration gives the waiting times for individual customers in this scenario. Notice what happens. Sixty-\nfive customers will wait 5 seconds or longer. In the next 5 seconds, 7 of those customers reach agents, so 58 customers are still\nwaiting 10 seconds or longer. In the next 5 seconds, 6 more customers will reach agents, leaving 52 waiting 15 seconds or more.\nAnd so forth. There’s still a customer waiting at 3 minutes. As you can see, no customer is waiting 4 minutes or more.\nSo, the contact center reports an ASA of 12.7 seconds and everything’s dandy—other than for those unhappy customers who\nsay they waited “several minutes” to get through. “C’mon,” you say. “ASA is less than 15 seconds! Surely no one waited more\nthan 30 seconds, tops!” Take a deeper look, though, and the real story becomes clear."

    "text": "✽✽✽\nHow Systems Calculate Service Level\nThere are a number of ways systems can be set up to calculate service level. (My thanks to\nconsultant Cheryl Odee Helm for providing a summary for an earlier edition of this book.) You\nwill need to know which calculation is being used since each handles abandoned calls\ndifferently. Here are some common formulas for calculating service level:\n1. (CONTACTS ANSWERED IN Y SECONDS + CONTACTS ABANDONED IN Y\nSECONDS) ÷ (TOTAL CONTACTS ANSWERED + TOTAL CONTACTS\nABANDONED). This calculation takes all contacts into consideration and is generally a good\napproach. Contacts that abandon before the objective (e.g., 20 seconds) help—not hurt—service\nlevel.\n2. CONTACTS ANSWERED IN Y SECONDS ÷ TOTAL CONTACTS ANSWERED.\nThis alternative only considers contacts reaching agents and is not a good reflection of all\nactivity. Outsourcers being measured on abandonment like it, because a high abandonment rate\ndoes not “ding” them on service level too. But given that abandonment is entirely ignored, I do\nnot recommend this calculation.\n3. CONTACTS ANSWERED IN Y SECONDS ÷ (TOTAL CONTACTS ANSWERED +\nTOTAL CONTACTS ABANDONED). This alternative tends to be the least popular among\nmany contact center managers because all contacts that abandon, even those that abandon before\nthe objective, negatively affect service level. It’s a favorite of some, though. As consultant Laura\nGrimes puts it, “It’s the high road calculation; it gives me an edge over other methods in building\na business case for agents.”\n4. CONTACTS ANSWERED IN Y SECONDS ÷ (TOTAL CONTACTS ANSWERED +\nCONTACTS ABANDONED AFTER Y SECONDS). With this calculation, abandoned\ncontacts only have a negative impact on service level if they happen after the Y seconds\nspecified. Contacts that abandon before the objective do not affect service level. This calculation\nis a way to avoid getting “penalized” by customers who abandon quickly without ignoring\nabandoned contacts altogether. All things considered, this is a good approach.\nWhatever approach you settle on, it’s important to use it consistently and ensure others\nunderstand the assumptions you are making. And if you’re in a multisite operation, or have a mix\nof internal and outsourced services, you should all use the same formula. You may have different\nservice levels for different queues, but use the same formula.\nGiving Service Level Teeth\nFor service level to have meaning, you must view it over an appropriate time frame. Daily\nservice level reports often conceal important information. Service level can take a big hit in the\nmorning, but if you have staff handling every contact immediately much of the afternoon, the\ndaily report may look fine. The level of service from customers’ perspectives is a different story."

    "text": "Managers who are held accountable for daily reports have an incentive to manage\ninappropriately. If the morning was rough, they may keep agents plugged in and handling the\nwork through the afternoon just to make the reports look better. That’s a waste of time and\nresources, and it doesn’t help customers who encountered poor service earlier in the day.\nIf daily reports are potentially misleading, monthly averages for service level are virtually\nmeaningless. They simply don’t reflect the day-by-day, half-hour-by-half-hour realities. Monthly\nreports that aggregate data remain an all-too-common way to summarize activity to senior\nmanagement (we’ll look at better alternatives in Chapter 10).\nGenerally, reports only tell you what is happening to the contacts that get through. If your\ncontact center uses busy signals or messages to deflect work, then service level must be\ninterpreted in light of contacts that aren’t getting through. In fact, you can (but should not) make\nreports such as service level and average speed of answer look as good as you want by limiting\nthe contacts that get through or manipulating order of answer.\n✽✽✽\nWAIT—THAT’S CHEATING!\nI once did some consulting work for a contact center handling service for a large utility. They had two people, referred to as\n“traffic controllers,” who monitored the queue and helped facilitate staffing adjustments as necessary."

    "text": "I learned they had a few tricks up their sleeves. For example, if service level began to slip, they would take blocks of queued\ncalls and put them into a holding pattern, allowing calls just entering the system to go right to agents. As the queue settled down,\nthey would release the calls from the holding pattern and allow them to reach agents. It was like putting aircraft over a busy\nairport into a holding pattern and allowing newer arrivals to land first. In this way, they could literally control their service level\nresults—or at least how they appeared in reports.\nThe happy ending is that they acknowledged and stopped the practice, and (though the reports looked worse for a while)\nwere able to make meaningful adjustments to staffing levels. It was a good reminder: there are many ways to make reports tell\nany story you want. But if you want to improve, you must have accurate information that relays the unvarnished truth.\n✽✽✽\nChoosing Service Level Objectives\nThe number of staff you need to handle contacts and the schedules you produce should flow\nfrom your service level objective. Imagine that, in a half-hour period, you’re going to receive 50\ncontacts that take an average of five minutes to handle. If you have only two agents, the delay\ntime for most customers will be long, and you’ll probably have high abandonment. As you add\nagents, delay times will drop.\nHow many people should you add? Enough to reduce the queue to an acceptable level for\nyou and your customers. In other words, the answer to that question becomes your service level\ntarget, and you won’t be able to achieve your target without the correct level of resources.\nThere is generally no “industry standard” service level that you can rely on for guidance.\n(There are exceptions: for example, service levels for many utilities are regulated.) The optimum\nservice level is affected by a host of factors, including the value of contacts, fully loaded labor\ncosts, telecommunications and bandwidth costs, customer tolerances, the organization’s\ncustomer access strategy and the desire and commitment to differentiate through service. An\nindustry standard would require that organizations have the same values for these things.\nThe correct service level for your organization is the one that:\n▪ Supports the organization’s mission and brand\n▪ Meets customers’ needs and expectations\n▪ Keeps abandonment at acceptable levels\n▪ Minimizes agent burnout and errors\n▪ Minimizes expenses\n▪ Maximizes revenue\n▪ Is understood and supported by senior management\nThere are essentially five approaches you can use to determine your service level objectives."

While it’s always important to know what your customers expect,\nrandom contact arrival means that different customers have different experiences. Even for a\nrelatively modest service level such as 80 percent answered in 60 seconds, more than half of the\ncustomers will get an immediate answer. Some, though, will wait in queue for 3 to 5 minutes,\nassuming no overflow or other contingency (we’ll go over how to make these calculations in\nChapter 7). As a result, many in that set of customers would say that your service level is great,\nwhile a handful would tell you that it is poor.\n✽✽✽\nALTERNATIVES FOR CHOOSING A SERVICE LEVEL OBJECTIVE\n▪ Listen to the voice of the customer\n▪ Go with a “typical” objective\n▪ Relate to competition—go higher/lower\n▪ Minimize abandonment\n▪ Use a combined approach\n✽✽✽\nHere’s an interesting survey approach I’ve seen some managers take. They query individual\ncustomers about how long they waited in queue (with encouragement to not glance at the timer\non their phone). They then compare the responses with the actual wait times of those contacts. In\nmany customer service settings, waits of up to 60–90 seconds are okay with customers. But\nbeyond about 90 seconds, customers’ view of reality can become skewed, and their moods can\nsour. Those who wait 3 minutes in queue may say they waited 4 or 5. Those who wait 5 minutes\nwill often tell you they waited 8 or 10 minutes. At some point as service deteriorates, perception\nis worse than reality, so you’ll want to consider what your customers believe is happening (see\nfigure, Perception of the Queue)."

The 80/20 objective was once\npublished in ACD manuals as an industry standard. In reality, it never was, but many early call\ncenters used this target. The objective 80/20 is still fairly common because for many contact\ncenters it is a reasonable balance between customers’ expectations and the practicality of having\nenough staff to meet the objective. It may or may not be right for you.\nA third alternative for choosing service level objectives is to look at competitive or industry\nnorms and determine whether you want to emulate them or stand out. Chewy.com, a Florida-\nbased online retailer of pet supplies, answers most calls within five seconds. If you mention the\norganization in a social media channel, a “Chewtopian” usually responds in a matter of minutes.\nThis accessibility—and the amazing service you get once connected—has helped Chewy thrive\nin a competitive market.\nWhen benchmarking, keep in mind that the results reported by others and what they are\nactually achieving may be two very different things. I recall working with two different\ninsurance companies that, at first glance, seemed similar. But according to surveys, one had far\nhappier customers and employees. On deeper dive, it became clear that this organization was\ndelivering services much more consistently, tracking and managing it by increment. The other\ncompany was reporting service level as an average for the month, and was predictably getting\nclobbered on Monday mornings and at other key times. You have to know what’s really\nhappening for benchmarks to make sense."

    "text": "✽✽✽\nTHE QUICK VERSION OF CHOOSING A SERVICE LEVEL OBJECTIVE\nI often hear, “Okay, the analysis is fine, but let’s get to the point: What should our service level objective be?”\nFair enough. If you’re in a competitive industry, such as retail, shipping, or mutual funds, and want to be on the high end of\nthe scale, 90/20 is fairly common. Others go for 85/15 or 90/15. If you hit these targets fairly consistently, your abandonment rate\nwill likely be around 1 percent or 2 percent. Going for the middle of the road? 80/20 is common. That’s what a lot of banks, insurance companies and travel reservation\ncenters shoot for. Other popular mid-range service levels are 80/30 and 90/60. Hit any of these objectives consistently, and you’ll\ngenerally see abandonment rates of 3 percent or 4 percent. Want a service level that is more modest? Targets common with many technical support centers and government\norganizations are 70/60, 80/120 or even 80/300. Abandonment can climb to 10 percent, 15 percent or higher. But hold your\njudgment—some of these organizations do a great job of using the resources they have to hit these objectives consistently. Of course, there are exceptions to the norm in any industry. For example, technical support operations that charge for\nsupport, or that serve internal customers who have time-sensitive requirements, maintain comparatively high service levels. Also,\ninterpret these numbers with common sense. If you are an emergency service center, you will target 100/0. On the other end of\nthe scale, there are centers for which 80/300 is a dream. I once worked with a center that was blocking over 70 percent of\ncustomer contacts, yet still losing a large portion of those that got through due to excruciatingly long waits (they’ve since\ndramatically turned things around). Above all, remember that it’s not just how high your objectives are, but how consistently you hit them. If you really want to\nsee how you’re doing and what realistic targets might be, produce service level graphs like those shown in Chapter 8. ✽✽✽\nRealistic Targets, Taken Seriously\nIf your operation is chronically missing your target, it may be an indication of a fundamental\nmisconception about the importance of service level. You’ll need to focus on a service level\nobjective that your organization can realistically achieve. Once you know your center’s true\ncapabilities, you must be able to back up your objectives with the right amount of resources. Service level should not be a “goal,” something that is nice to strive for. An airline doesn’t have\nthe “goal” of reaching Montréal when the plane takes off from Mexico City. It’s a concrete\nobjective, supported by adequate resources (fuel, pilots, navigation equipment, etc.). Why is it that some contact centers don’t get the resources they need? Sometimes it’s\nbecause the money isn’t available."

    "text": "SERVICE LEVEL ACROSS CHANNELS\nContact center professionals often liken the time it takes for customers to receive a reply to a non-phone contact to what\nservice level means to inbound calls. But there is an important difference: speed-of-answer statistics associated with calls are\nbased on when the call reaches the agent. But speed-of-response for other kinds of contacts—e.g., chat, social media, text, email\n—is based on when the customer receives a reply, which can only happen after the agent actually handles the inquiry. Is this distinction important? That depends. For email—where response time is typically measured in hours—it doesn’t\nmatter much (see discussion on response time, below). But chat and social media interactions that need to take place as they arise\nare a different matter. Response is measured in seconds or minutes, and the time required for the agent to craft the reply must be\ntaken into account. I’ve seen cases where well-intentioned executives set a target for exchanges of three minutes or less when it\ntakes longer than that to create the reply! That’s a recipe for disaster (or, at the least, for missed targets). It is up to the\nmanagement team to establish workable objectives supported by the right level of resources. ✽✽✽\nUnderstanding and Using Response Time Objectives\nResponse time is the equivalent of service level for contacts that don’t have to be handled\nwhen they arrive. Response time, like service level, becomes the critical link between the\nresources you need and the results you want to achieve. Variations on Response Time\nThere are often several components to the organization’s response. The most common are:\nAUTOMATED REPLY: This is a system-generated reply to the customer, acknowledging\nthat a message they sent was received and informing them of when to expect an agent-assisted\nresponse. This establishes appropriate expectations and minimizes additional contacts inquiring\nabout the status of the original message. AGENT-ASSISTED RESPONSE: This refers to the response the customer receives when\nthe interaction is actually handled by an agent. The time that elapses between the customer’s\noriginal message and the contact center’s response is measured as response time. RESOLUTION: This is a measure of when the problem or issue is actually resolved and is\nused in environments where the contact center’s initial response may not fully resolve the issue. For example, in a technical support environment, additional research may be necessary; the\nproblem is “resolved” when the matter is handled to completion and the case is closed. Additionally, there are two primary types of response time, scheduled and rolling. Scheduled\nresponse time, like dry-cleaning service, is geared around blocks of time. For example, you may\ncommit to handle all messages received up to noon by 4 p.m., and to respond to messages\nreceived between noon and 5 p.m. by 10 a.m. the next day."

Today, many\ncontact centers still have straightforward, 24-hour scheduled response time objectives (or a close\nvariation, such as by end of next business day). But some have raised the bar and set objectives\nof several hours or less. A small but growing number of centers are handling what used to be\nresponse-time-type contacts (such as email or social media messages) as they do inbound calls:\nqueuing them and handling them as they arrive. In this case, service level (rather than response\ntime) objectives apply.\nAn important step in establishing response time objectives is to inform customers up front\nwhat they can expect. Otherwise, what started as a single inquiry that is still in queue can turn\ninto additional contacts.\nInternal Communications"

Likewise, internal\ncollaboration tools are becoming pervasive, but you’ll need to talk through expectations and get\nagreement on when and how they will best be used.\nThe Link to Quality\nWhen you talk about being accessible, someone is bound to bring up an important point: you\ncan achieve your service level (or response time) objectives and miss by a mile on quality. Your\nagents can misunderstand customer requests, enter data incorrectly, relay the wrong information\nto customers, miss opportunities to capture valuable feedback, and unnecessarily cause\nunnecessary repeat contacts.\nBut over time and fundamentally, service level and quality are complementary. In fact, you\ncannot have one without the other, at least not for long. Consider how poor quality jeopardizes\nservice level. What happens when data is not entered correctly?

To many, it sounds mechanical—a humdrum step\non the path to bigger and better things. Au contraire!\nInaccurate forecasts, spotty quality and unnecessary costs can all stem from a lack of good\ninformation. Acquiring the data that you need will take you to all corners of your organization\nand into the farthest reaches of the external environment. It’s one of the most involved,\npolitically-charged and outwardly-focused aspects of successfully managing a customer contact\ncenter. And it can be quite a bit of fun!\nSources of Data\nThe information necessary for effective planning and management comes from many\ndifferent places. Consider the systems, departments and external sources of information that a\ncustomer support operation for (let’s say) a financial services firm would turn to (listed in no\nspecific order):\n▪ Customer information systems\n▪ ACD systems\n▪ Quality observation/recording systems\n▪ Workforce optimization systems\n▪ Social media management tools\n▪ Analytics and AI applications\n▪ Web servers\n▪ CRM applications\n▪ Email servers"

A critical consideration for effectively using data is to\nunderstand what it represents. “There are many ways to compile and report data and often a\ndeeper dive is necessary to really understand it. How systems report data, what’s included, the\ntimeframes involved, and other factors will shape the story it’s telling.”\nDiverse Requirements\nFor an appreciation of the diverse information requirements in today’s customer contact\nenvironment, consider how job titles and responsibilities are evolving. Through the early 2000s,\nthe same person or team (depending on the size of the center) would do the hiring, coaching,\nforecasting, and just about everything else that goes into running a contact center. Many\nmanagers were also involved in staffing and scheduling.\nToday, many additional job roles and responsibilities have emerged, each requiring different\ntypes of information from different sources, and with a unique combination of both “push” and\n“pull” requirements (see sidebar). In larger centers, job roles can include forecasting analysts,\ntraining managers, quality specialists, knowledge managers, reporting analysts, finance\nmanagers, traffic controllers, team leaders and supervisors, real-time coordinators, and\nprofessionals with a host of other titles and positions. If you run a small contact center, you\nprobably wear many of these increasingly specialized hats! (See Chapter 16 for more on\norganization and job roles.)\nGiven the need for specialized roles, along with the numerous variables affecting the contact\ncenter’s workload, it’s easy to understand why many organizations that were previously\nsuccessful at developing accurate forecasts and plans are now finding this activity more\nchallenging. The process for acquiring, interpreting, and using the data has become almost as\nimportant as the data itself. Those who view the data collection step as little more than a rote,\nmechanical process are severely underestimating its importance.\n✽✽✽\nPush and Pull Requirements\nInformation requirements can be broadly categorized as either \"push\" or \"pull.\"\nPush: The information needs to be delivered as soon as it becomes available (e.g., workload trends that impact real-time\nresource requirements).\nPull: The information is stored and is accessible as needed (e.g., HR data on tenure by recruiting source).\n✽✽✽"

    "text": "Identifying the Information You Need\nA great way to identify gaps in getting and using the data you’ll need for planning and\nmanagement is to create a flowchart of the nine-step planning process (covered in Chapters 1\nthrough 10) and the data required for each step. The chart should identify:\n▪ The information you need for each step\n▪ The form it should take\n▪ Where it comes from\n▪ How it is produced\n▪ When you need it\n▪ How and when it fits into the planning process\nThis exercise will identify missing links in your data collection activities and lead to ideas for\ndeveloping a more integrated, collaborative approach. For best results, you’ll need to update your\nflowchart fairly regularly (I suggest twice yearly). A similar approach can be used for other\noperational priorities, such as quality improvement.\nBuilding Cross-Functional Processes\nIdentifying the information you need begins with a clear customer access strategy. Your\ncustomer access strategy will help to define such things as customer segments, agent group\nstructure, service level objectives, the information needed for handling contacts, and so on (see\nChapter 2). The components of your strategy will, in turn, help define specific data requirements.\nMany contact centers have assigned a person or a group of people to handle essential\nplanning responsibilities (i.e., forecasting, staffing, and scheduling). As a part of their job, they\nare given the task of collecting information required for these activities. But if they don’t get the\ncross-functional input they need, this becomes more difficult at best. The organizations that do\nthe best job of planning have developed cross-functional planning teams.\nAs part of both planning and voice of the customer strategies, some organizations hold\nregular (typically weekly) meetings with representatives from departments throughout the\norganization who review customer input and implications for projects and processes. And given\nthe many diverse aspects of good planning, some organizations have established a “planning\nmanager” position whose primary function is to enhance cross-functional communication within\nthe organization and use the shared information to drive better forecasts and plans.\nCross-functional planning groups can take many forms. Some examples:\n▪ Daily huddles have become an important part of many contact centers. They typically\ninvolve contact center leadership, workforce management, quality assurance, and other areas,"

But good results don’t happen just because new information is available.\nFrom the information, contact center managers must identify opportunities and potential\nproblems, and develop appropriate plans and action items.\nOne of the key benefits of ACD, workforce optimization, quality observation, customer\nrelationship management (CRM), and other contact center systems has always been their ability\nto produce reports—lots of them. In the past, reporting was system-specific and based primarily\non parameters defined by the suppliers.\nToday’s systems are characterized by flexibility and interfaces that allow reporting and\nintegration across an organization (and beyond, to include service partners, suppliers, and\nothers). Anyone who is granted access can view, extract, manipulate, make graphical, print, and\nstore real-time and historical information. This trend has been enormously helpful in raising the\ncontact center’s profile within the organization.\nMost systems also have the capability to export data to a variety of formats. This allows\nanyone with some technical skill (they don’t need to be programmers) to develop custom reports\nthat combine information from multiple systems. The result has been reports and analysis that\ngive a much more three-dimensional view of customer interactions—i.e., you can correlate\ndetails such as contact types, channels, quality scores and contact trends with customer\ndemographics, marketing campaigns, sales, customer satisfaction, buying histories, and other\nrelevant information.\nAnother highly useful development is the ability to model and test different scenarios.\nExamples include:\n▪ Quality observation, text and speech analytics, and performance management tools can use"

For example, communications monitoring technologies are in widespread use.\nHowever, too many organizations implement these technologies without adequate training on\nappropriate policies and practices. In many cases, supervisors have been handed technologies\nwith potentially enormous legal, quality and productivity implications. And within organizations\nwith multiple sites, policies and practices often differ between locations.\nA related challenge is the balance between service and privacy, and the uneasiness many\ncustomers feel about the sheer quantity of information that is being captured, shared, integrated\nwith other data, and used for management and marketing purposes. And employees can feel\nmuch the same: “The computer watches me all the time; it never blinks.” These issues require\nsound and up-to-date policies on customer privacy, data protection, internal observation practices\nand good communication with all involved. (See Chapter 14 for more on quality observation and\nrelated issues.)\nSome managers have also assumed that new systems can practically “run the business.” And\nyet, an understanding of underlying processes and a supporting culture are necessary for these\ncapabilities to reach their potential. For example:\n▪ Workforce optimization systems don’t coordinate with marketing, watch economic reports,\nor define how the organization should be structured.\n▪ Quality observation systems can’t define quality standards or the strategic value of\nexcellent quality for your operation.\n▪ Real-time management information can’t compel agents to want to be in the right place at\nthe right times.\n▪ The rich information provided by reporting, analytics, and collaboration tools doesn’t\ninherently bring business units together to create better products, services, and customer\nexperiences.\nAs capable as today’s systems are, they require effective leadership and clear direction."

To do that, you first look at historical data to\ndetermine patterns that reflect when people contact you, and you consider possible trends that\nwill affect patterns going forward.\nYou then take that information and break it into contacts by months, weeks of the month,\ndays of the week, and half hours of the day—or even five minutes of the half hour if you are\nforecasting peaked traffic. Next, you factor in the handling times of the interactions. Finally, you\nmodify results based on conditions that are not reflected in the historical data.\nWeekly, daily, and intraday forecasts are short-term tactical forecasts used to tighten up\nschedules and adjust priorities around current conditions and near-term events.

    "text": "Agent Group\nAgent groups are the building blocks of a contact center. An agent group (also called a split,\ngate, queue, or skills group) shares a common set of skills and knowledge, handles a specified\nmix of contacts (e.g., service, sales, technical support) and/or channels (e.g., phone, chat, social\nmedia, email). and may comprise a handful of agents or hundreds of agents across multiple sites.\nSupervisory groups and teams are often subsets of agent groups.\nYour forecasts will be built around agent groups. If you have one group of 100 agents\nhandling all contacts, you’ll have one forecast and one set of schedules. If you have 10 groups of\naround 10 agents, you’ll need 10 forecasts and schedules—one for each unique agent group. In\nother words, planning must be specific enough to ensure that you get the right number of\nproperly skilled people and supporting resources in place at the right times, for each agent group.\nWorkload\nThe basic historical data you need to forecast for an agent group includes how many contacts\nyou have received in the past, when they arrived and how long they took to handle. Four key\nterms reflect this activity:\n▪ TALK TIME is everything from “hello” to “goodbye.” In other words, it’s the time\ncustomers are connected with agents. Anything that happens during talk time—such as putting\nthe customer on hold to confer with a supervisor, research an issue or make an outbound call—\nshould be included in this measurement.\n▪ AFTER-CALL WORK (also referred to as ACW, wrap-up, or not ready) is the time\nagents spend completing contacts after saying goodbye to customers. Legitimate after-call work\nshould immediately follow talk time.\n▪ AVERAGE HANDLING TIME (AHT) is average talk time plus average after-call work.\n▪ WORKLOAD (also referred to as call load) is the volume of contacts coupled with how\nlong they last. The formula is volume × average handling time, for a given period of time.\nWhile these terms are typical and make sense for calls, they can vary for other channels. For\nexample, “talk time” and “after-call work” are fine for video. They don’t make sense for email or\ntext, where “handling time” is a better fit. In an omnichannel environment, the channels you\nhandle will dictate the terms that best describe workload components.\nIn an omnichannel environment, the channels you handle will dictate the terms that best\ndescribe workload components.\nFor chat or social media, the series of exchanges with a customer over a short period of time\n(the back-and-forth that takes place in many of these interactions) is referred to as a session\n(chat) or conversation (social media). You’ll need to anticipate the number of customer sessions\nor conversations, the time it takes to handle them and the number of customers an agent can\nsimultaneously handle. We’ll discuss variations as we consider other channels, in this chapter"

Don’t make the mistake of taking existing data from systems\nand using it “as is” without giving it a second thought. What if the IVR was down for an hour? What if a reporting system\nmalfunctioned for part of a morning? What if a breaking news story impacted workload?\nI remember working with a large contact center in Australia during the Melbourne Cup—the thoroughbred horse race that is\none of the most-watched sporting events of the year. Just before the race, contacts plummeted, then resumed in a matter of\nminutes after its conclusion. It was fascinating to see the race on one monitor and follow real-time contact center traffic on\nanother.\nWhat about unique variables in your environment that will, or will not, repeat and that need to be either included in or\nbacked out of the numbers? Making adjustments that reflect what’s likely to continue will ensure that you are building forecasts\non a solid foundation.\n✽✽✽\nOffered Contacts\nOffered contacts include all of the attempts your customers make to reach you. There are\nthree possibilities for offered contacts: they can get a busy signal or message (rare in most\ncontact centers); they can be received by the system but abandon before reaching an agent; or\nthey can successfully reach an agent. In forecasting, what you really want to know is the number\nof individuals attempting to reach you.\nAcquiring data on abandoned contacts is usually straightforward. Most routing systems\nprovide reports on abandonments down to specific increments of time."

    "page_number": 84,
    "text": "Many managers count abandoned contacts “one-for-one.” But to the degree that customers\nwho abandon try again later and get through to agents, they will be counted more than once. Consequently, you may want to “normalize” or discount them. If available, it’s helpful to have\nhard data, which can come from automatic number identification (ANI), calling line\nidentification (CLI) reports, or other systems. Without good data, you run the risk of discounting too deeply, which will lead to forecasts\nthat underestimate demand. I generally recommend that you include most (70 percent or more)\nabandoned contacts in the data, unless you have solid information that tells you otherwise. This\nmay lead to forecasts that overstate demand; however, forecasts that underestimate the workload\nwill result in insufficient staffing and abandoned contacts, which perpetuate the problem. Similarly, busy signals will need to be discounted in the data you use for forecasting. Busies\nare far less common today than they once were (and I rarely recommend intentionally using\nthem). But they still can and do happen. When they do, they wreak havoc on reports. The age-old\nquestion is, for every 100 busy signals, was that 100 people who tried to reach you once, or one\npersistent soul who tried 100 times? Of course, the answer usually is somewhere in between. If your ACD can dynamically generate busy signals based on real-time circumstances, it will\nlikely provide a report on how many customers received busies. Telecommunications network\ncarriers can also provide reports that can help solve the retry mystery. Alternatives to retry\nreports can include customer surveys, answering all contacts for a short period (even if by\nvoicemail) to determine true demand, and judgment (guessing). Naturally, it’s best to have hard\ndata. In sum, your forecast should, as accurately as possible, reflect the number of individuals\nattempting to reach you. If you count every abandoned contact or busy signal in the data you use,\nthe forecast will overestimate true demand. If you ignore busy signals and abandoned contacts,\nthe forecast will underestimate demand. IVRs and Routing Contingencies\nMany organizations use interactive voice response units (IVRs) to provide customers with\nself-service options and to help route contacts (“press or say one” or “tell us the reason for your\ncall”). Additionally, contingency-based routing alternatives can mean that contacts start out in\none place and end up in another depending on real-time circumstances. I always feel most comfortable when I know how the systems are configured and how\ncontacts reach their destinations. (I’ll often have someone walk me through a step-by-step\nflowchart so that I understand.) You’ll need a forecast specific to each agent group for staffing\npurposes. In other words, count and forecast the contacts intended for each individual agent\ngroup so that your forecasts and staff predictions are accurate going forward."

You will still need to blend in judgment, coordinate with\nmarketing, etc. (see upcoming discussions). After all, past history doesn’t always reflect what’s\ngoing to happen in the future.\nYou may also need to incorporate other patterns into the forecast. For example, if you send\nout billing statements twice a month, that activity will generate traffic when the bills begin to\narrive. But the percent increase caused by these events will also fall into predictable patterns, and\nyou can adjust accordingly. You may need to calculate day-of-month index factors, a process\nsimilar to deriving day-of-week index factors.\nHoliday Weeks\nHoliday weeks will require their own index factors. But the pattern for one week with a\nholiday on a Monday will often be similar to another week in the year with a holiday on a\nMonday. Holidays that fall on various days of the week are another reason to hang on to your\nhistorical data.\nExamples of Calculating Day-of-Week Index Factors for a Week with a Holiday\nIntraday Forecasts\nIntraday or intraweek forecasts are quick and easy to produce, and are often quite accurate."

Your reports indicate that you have received 402\ncontacts so far, which may be more or fewer than originally expected. Either way, you divide the\nusual proportion of the day’s contacts that you would expect by 10:30—18 percent in this case—\ninto 402 (18 percent came from looking at traffic patterns on previous days and calculating half-\nhourly proportions). Bingo, you now know that if the trend continues, you can expect to receive\n2,233 contacts for the day.\nIntraday Forecasting\nNext, you can break down the revised daily forecast into the remaining half hours by\nmultiplying historical half-hourly proportions by 2,233. For example, since you would normally\nexpect to get 6.6 percent (.066) of a day’s contacts between 3:30 and 4:00 p.m., you can expect\n147 calls during that half hour.\nThe assumption behind intraday forecasting is that the morning will set the tone for the\nafternoon. However, if you are a utility getting swamped with contacts in the morning due to a\nmajor power outage, this is a bad assumption. When the outage is fixed, the contacts will go\naway. In many cases, though, intraday forecasting is a useful and accurate tool. You can use\nsimilar logic to create an intraweek forecast.\nIntraweek Forecasting\nDirect Marketing Campaigns\nMost organizations that run direct marketing campaigns will look at typical response rates to\nhelp forecast workloads.

One of the things that makes this tricky is that there are\noften overlapping campaigns going on at any given time.

So, you and your marketing\nteam will need to decide on definitions and stick to them so that you have a solid baseline to\nwork from.\nDirect Marketing\nPeaked Arrival\nIn many ways, underlying forecasting principles are similar for both random and peaked\ntraffic.

While half-hour\nreports are sufficient for random workload arrival, you will need historical reports down to more\nspecific increments of time (five- or 10-minute segments) in order to adequately forecast and\nstaff for peaked traffic.\nThe other big difference is that the specific targeted promotions you are delivering—\ntelevision or radio ads, for example—will dramatically influence response. That’s true for any\nkind of marketing, of course, but because of concentrated workload arrivals, the impact on\ncontact center resources is that much greater. The audience you are reaching (numbers and\ndemographics), the products and services being offered, the channels you are making available,\nand the effectiveness of the ads themselves will drive how many contacts you get, the nature of\nthe interactions, and how concentrated they are within a specific timeframe.

You may have a choice between running television ads at precise\ntimes, or receiving discounts to run them anytime within a larger block of time (as the network’s\nprogramming needs dictate). Ad-buy savings can quickly evaporate when you weigh the costs of\nhaving staff standing by. These decisions should be made collaboratively (including marketing,\nthe contact center and the media partner), with the total picture in mind. Social Media\nSocial media monitoring tools—which range from free to high-end and can be standalone or\nintegrated into existing contact center systems—enable you to make sense of what’s being said\nabout your company, products, and services. They can help you identify customer sentiment,\ninfluencers, where conversations are taking place, and which are having the most impact on the\nperception of your brand. And some social media posts are clearly customer service contacts—\nindividuals who need and expect a response. Armed with this information, you can establish criteria for when and how to engage and\ndetermine what needs to be included in the workload that is delivered to your agents. As part of\nforecasting, you’ll want to divide the workload into categories, including one-to-many responses\nwhere anyone can see (and potentially benefit from) the post, versus direct messages to\nindividuals. Further categories might include known and unknown issues—any grouping has\ndistinct handling time requirements. If you’re launching a new channel and don’t have as much to go by, think more along the\nlines of forecasting the weather: Partly cloudy this morning, with a warming trend this afternoon. You won’t always get it right. Look out as far as possible, think through as many variables as\nfeasible, and observe patterns and how they are developing. In the end, dress for any kind of\nweather (meaning, build flexibility and scalability into your staffing plans). The good news is that underlying patterns almost always exist. Yes, social media trending\ntopics and posts that quickly multiply can create unique staffing challenges. But being responsive\nearly can help head off what would be repetitive contacts. The same basic principles apply: look\nfor patterns, consider the variables, and use what you’re seeing to project future workload. (See\nPioneer Forecasts, below). ✽✽✽\nPIONEER FORECASTS\nNew products, marketing campaigns, support channels or accounts may not have much, or any, history you can use for\nforecasting.

If the week is “typical,” the data represented by this pattern is what\nwill likely continue.\nThe graph of average handling time (above) is from a mobile phone company.

LOOK FOR PATTERNS. For each agent group, identify how average talk time and\naverage after-call work vary. You may also discover patterns by day of the week, season of the\nyear, billing cycles or marketing campaigns. For contact channels that have both, make separate\ngraphs for average talk time and average after-call work. This will reveal the patterns for each.\n2. TRAIN YOUR AGENTS TO USE WORK MODES CONSISTENTLY. Each agent\nhas an impact on the components of handling time (talk time and after-call work) and on the data\nthat will be used in forecasting and planning for future workloads. When the queue is building, it\ncan be tempting to postpone some after-call work that should be done at the time of the contact.\nThis skews reports, causes planning problems, and may lead to increased errors. An important\nand ongoing training issue is to define ahead of time what type of work should follow contacts\nand what type of work can wait.\n3. IDENTIFY THE AVERAGE HANDLING TIME FOR DIFFERENT CONTACT\nTYPES. This assumes that you have defined and categorized contacts by type, that you are\naccurately tracking contacts based on the categories, and that you have the reporting capability to\nlink average handling time to the categories. A Pareto chart is often the best way to represent this\ndata.\nYou can use this information in a number of ways. For example, when you are forecasting an\nincrease or decrease of a specific type of contact, you will be able to project the impact on\naverage handling time. A marketing campaign will generate certain types of contacts. Launching\na new web-based service, AI capabilities or mobile app will likely reduce some types of contacts\nagents handle and may increase others.

The examples in this chapter are fairly basic, and more advanced alternatives within\neach category exist. I’ll introduce a few of them here to give you an idea of the breadth of\npossibilities.\nTime-series forecasting methods include simple or “naive” rules (e.g., the forecast equals last\nyear’s same month, plus 12 percent), decomposition, simple time-series, and advanced time-\nseries methods.

For more information, there are many courses (some of them contact center-\nspecific), books, software tools and other resources available.\n✽✽✽\nSOFTWARE AND SERVICES FOR ADVANCED FORECASTING\nIf you’re in an organization or industry going through significant changes, or if your center handles contacts generated by\ntelevision commercials or overlapping direct marketing campaigns, commonly-used time-series and explanatory techniques\nmight not cut it. Fortunately, there are alternatives.\nIncreasingly, today’s more advanced workforce optimization systems—as well as standalone business forecasting packages\nfrom sources such as SAS Forecast Server, Forecast Pro, and others—include a wide range of forecasting methodologies. These\nprograms enable you to build in multiple events and variables and produce forecasts based on different models.\nBy comparing forecasts, you can identify the best methodology for your environment. Because one approach might work\nbetter than others for specific types of events, you can change models as circumstances dictate. You may need an analyst to\nspearhead this effort, but more accurate forecasts (and therefore, better staffing plans and schedules) often provide a solid return\non the investment.\nYou may also want to explore outside services. For example, forecasting services offered by consultants can provide\nforecasts based on advanced methodologies for centers that need transitional or ongoing help. Similar services exist in other\nfields (e.g., financial and sales forecasting), and this alternative has become common and accessible in the contact center\nenvironment.\n✽✽✽\nBlending in Judgment\nSo far, we’ve looked at quantitative forecasting—in other words, how to use hard data in\nyour forecasting process.

Each participant brings a unique perspective to the process.\n▪ As each issue is discussed, the forecast is adjusted up or down, based on what the group\nbelieves will happen.\nThe collaborative approach is most effective when key team members who are accountable\nfor staffing take an active role in forecasting (in large contact centers, they can be rotated through\nthis process). The forecast not only improves as a result of their perspective, but these key team\nmembers gain an understanding of the factors that contribute to staffing. As a result, they lead\ntheir teams more effectively.\nMeasuring Accuracy—Strive for Five\nHow accurate should your forecast be? Large agent groups (100 or more agents) generally\nsee relatively stable workload patterns and should strive for plus or minus 5 percent (or better) of\nworkload down to specific intervals. Small groups (15 or fewer agents) often have more volatile\npatterns and should shoot for plus or minus 10 percent.

    "text": "Common Problems (That You Can Avoid!)\nThe ICMI team often investigates why some contact centers have accurate forecasts and\nothers don’t. Ten common problems consistently emerge, and they are summarized here (in no\nspecific order). In centers with inaccurate forecasts, usually two or three of these issues are most\nprevalent.\nThe good news? You can avoid these problems, and the remedies in most cases are fairly\nobvious.\n1. NO SYSTEMATIC PROCESS IN PLACE. There are often two erroneous beliefs that\nsome managers use to justify the absence of a systematic forecasting process. Some say, “Our\nenvironment is too unpredictable. We’re growing; we’re going omnichannel; we’re introducing\nnew services; you can’t predict social media interactions … there is no way we can produce an\naccurate forecast.” Just know, there are many centers in similar situations that are enjoying the\nbenefits of respectably accurate forecasts. Others aren’t convinced that forecasting is worth the\ntime. Yep, it takes time—but not nearly as much as some imagine. Further, a good forecast will\nsave a lot of time later on.\n2. AN ASSUMPTION THAT “THE FORECASTING SOFTWARE KNOWS BEST.” If\nyou have forecasting software or a workforce management system, don’t relinquish decisions to\nthe program, assuming that it knows best. The software doesn’t know what the marketing\ndepartment is about to do, or that average handling time will be affected by changes you are\nmaking to processes or systems.\nFurther, it is important to understand the assumptions your forecasting software is making.\nSome methods are user-definable. For example, you can program the system to give more weight\nto recent historical data, or you can tell it to ignore data that varies beyond X percent of the\nnorm. It’s a great idea to have the supplier provide a flow chart of the methodology the system is\nusing and decision points where your input is necessary.\n3. NOT FORECASTING AT THE AGENT GROUP LEVEL. Even a perfect forecast of\nthe aggregate workload will be of limited use if you route contacts to specialized groups. If you\nhave a group of Mandarin-speaking agents handling services A, B and C, you will need to\nforecast contacts from Mandarin-speaking customers who need help with those services.\n4. THE FORECAST IS TAKEN LIGHTLY. If the forecast has been wildly inaccurate in\nthe past or if no one understands the assumptions used in the process, it will not be given the\nprominence it needs in the planning steps to follow.\n5. EVENTS THAT SHOULD BE EXCEPTIONS BECOME A PART OF THE\nFORECAST. Utilities tend to get lots of contacts when storms knock out power, the financial\nindustry gets swamped when confusing tax changes are implemented, and many centers have, on\nat least one occasion, dealt with contacts from an uncoordinated marketing campaign. (Have\nyour agents ever had to sheepishly ask a customer, “Um, what does the promotion say we are\noffering?”)"

That will enable\nbetter judgment on what is likely to continue (and therefore should be built into the forecast)\nversus the exceptions. 6. ONGOING COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS DOESN’T\nEXIST. Most of what happens in a contact center is caused by something going on outside the\ncenter. The forecast is doomed if strong ties with other departments don’t exist. 7. PLANNING IS DONE AROUND GOALS, NOT REALITY. If staffing is based on a\nhandling time of four minutes when actual handling time is more like seven minutes, the\nresulting schedules will be based on a pipe dream. Maybe improved training, streamlined\nprocedures and better systems would move things in that direction. But ignoring reality in the\nplanning process is no way to achieve better results or build confidence in the forecast. 8. NO ONE IS ACCOUNTABLE. As vital as a good forecast is, often there is no one who\nspearheads the effort. Someone needs to be responsible for bringing the various types of input\ntogether, ensuring that it is integrated into the forecast, and investigating which assumptions\nwere off when the forecast is not accurate. 9. AGENTS ARE MIXING FLEXIBLE ACTIVITIES INTO WORK MODES. If agents\nare not using work modes consistently, especially after-call work, then accurate forecasting will\nbe elusive. 10. NOT MAKING THE CONNECTION WITH STAFFING. Forecasts mean nothing\nunless they are tied to staff and system resources required. That is the subject of Chapter 7. ✽✽✽\nONE DAY, A LONG TIME AGO\nAs a new manager many years ago, I recall the “pain” of having to deal with a “rogue” product manager who routinely\nbombarded my contact center with direct marketing campaigns, without giving my team (or me) any advance warning. The\nproduct manager, who we’ll call Theresa, had dropped three such campaigns on us the previous month and as you might expect,\nthe results were not pretty: Stressed out agents, angry customers, and a nightmare for our workforce management team, who were\nvaliantly trying to improve our forecasts. When the fourth “mystery” campaign hit the following week, I had Bob, our technology manager, reroute the 1-800 number\nto Theresa’s direct extension. In less than 10 minutes, I got a call from a distraught Theresa: “What the heck is going on with the\n1-800 campaign? How am I supposed to handle these calls?” My reply: “Now you know how we feel!”\nThings got better quickly. I explained that launching campaigns without properly preparing the contact center was not only\nstressful for our agents, it also reduced the success of the campaigns and potentially damaged our brand in the eyes of our\ncustomers. I’m older and wiser now, and NO, I don’t recommend trying this approach in your own center. It can get you fired! It was,\nadmittedly, the result of both my inexperience and Theresa’s in this area."

    "text": "If sorting out staffing for random call arrival is this involved with two agents, imagine a\nscenario with 15 agents. Or 115! The point is, to determine staffing correctly, you need the right\ntools. You need a method that takes the usual randomness of contact arrival into consideration.\nThat means using the Erlang C formula (or a variation of it) or computer simulation.\nStaffing the Right Way\nAs introduced in the first chapter, the widely used Erlang C formula was developed in 1917\nby A.K. Erlang, a Danish engineer with the Copenhagen Telephone Company. Erlang C can be\nused to determine resources in just about any situation where people might wait in queue for\nservice—whether it is at a ticket counter, a bank of elevators, or a concessions stand in a\nstadium. Erlang C (or a variation of it) is currently built into virtually all of the commercially\navailable workforce management software packages.\n(If you go to Copenhagen, Denmark, you can visit an interesting display on A.K. Erlang’s\nlife and work, in the building in which he used to work. I’ve been there. At the time, I was the\nonly one there … Okay, so it’s not the most popular attraction just yet.)\nErlang C calculates predicted waiting times (delay) based on three things: the number of\nservers (agents); the number of people waiting to be served (customers); and the average amount\nof time it takes to serve each person. It can also predict the resources required to keep waiting\ntimes within targeted limits, and that’s why it is useful for contact centers.\nAs with any mathematical formula, Erlang C has built-in assumptions that don’t perfectly\nreflect real-world circumstances. For one, it assumes that “lost calls are delayed.” In plain\nEnglish, that means that the formula assumes that customers are queued when no agent is\navailable. No problem with that. The problem is, it assumes that customers have infinite patience\n—they will wait as long as necessary to reach an agent and nobody will abandon. Oops!\nErlang C also assumes that you have infinite trunking and system capacity or that nobody\nwill ever get a busy signal. But busies, rare as they may be in many contact centers, can and do\nhappen. Oops again!"

Erlang C also assumes that you have the same level of\nstaff handling the workload the entire half hour. In reality, if service level starts taking a\nnosedive, you may be able to add reinforcements on short notice.\n✽✽✽\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Erlang C\nAdvantages\n✔ Assumes random arrival and that contacts go into queue if an agent is not immediately available\n✔ Is accurate at good service levels, where abandoned contacts and busy signals are minimal\n✔ Is easy and quick to use, and is available in software programs from a wide variety of sources\n✔ Illustrates resource tradeoffs well (e.g., when service level goes up, occupancy goes down)\n✔ Is the basis for staffing calculations in most workforce management programs\nDisadvantages\n✘ Assumes no abandoned contacts or busy signals\n✘ Assumes “steady-state” arrival, or that traffic does not increase or decrease beyond random fluctuation within the time\nperiod\n✘ Assumes you have a fixed number of staff handling the work throughout the time period\n✘ Assumes that all agents within a group can handle the contacts presented to the group\n✘ Calculations assume no contacts in queue from the prior half hour (unless the user or workforce management system\nmakes this adjustment)\n✽✽✽\nSo then why is Erlang C so popular? As you might guess, there are defensible reasons to use\nit. For one, it’s a planning tool, and most contact centers are planning to have good service\nlevels. Erlang C is fairly accurate for good service levels—and when service level is decent, you\nshould theoretically have little in the way of lost contacts or busy signals. If you do have a lot of\ncontacts abandoning or getting busy signals, it’s probably because you don’t have enough staff to\nhandle the load. In that case, who’s worried about overstaffing? As your staffing more accurately\nreflects the workload demand, Erlang C will inherently become more accurate.\nAdditionally, if you adjust for abandoned contacts and busy signals (which Erlang C does not\ndo) and retry rates turn out to be higher than you estimate, you could end up underestimating"

As much\nscience as may be involved, it’s inexact and must be augmented with common sense and\nresource plans that are at least somewhat flexible.\nBase Staff\nRecall the two major categories of contacts defined in Chapter 4: those that must be handled\nwhen they arrive (service level contacts) and those that can be handled at a later time (response\ntime contacts). Let’s look first at calculating base staff for service level contacts, using Erlang C.\nService Level\nOne of the advantages of using Erlang C is that it is a great educational tool, and it illustrates\nqueue dynamics and resource tradeoffs well.

Because 82 percent meets your standard,\nthat’s the row on which you would concentrate. Next, glancing across that row, you can see that you need 34 agents (first column), average\nspeed of answer will be 13 seconds (third column), etc. In other words, each column provides\ninsight and information into the service level you choose. Here’s what the column headings stand for:\nAGENTS: number of agents required to be plugged in and available to handle contacts. In\nthis example, 34 agents will achieve a service level of 82 percent answered in 20 seconds. P(0): probability of a delay greater than zero seconds. In other words, the probability of not\ngetting an immediate answer. In this example, about 29 percent of contacts will be delayed. That\nmeans 71 percent of customers won’t be delayed, but instead will go right to an agent. ASA: average speed of answer. With 34 agents handling calls, ASA will be 13 seconds. ASA\nis the average delay of all contacts, including the ones that aren’t delayed at all. In this example,\n250 contacts are included in the calculation. (See discussion on why ASA is often misinterpreted,\nChapter 4.)\nDLYDLY: average delay of delayed contacts. This is the average delay of those contacts that\nare delayed—43 seconds, in this example. DLYDLY is a better reflection than ASA of what’s\nactually happening to the customers that end up in queue. But keep in mind, it’s still an average. Some wait five seconds and others may wait several minutes. If customers end up in queue any\namount of time, they will be included in the calculation. Q1: average number of contacts in queue at any time, including times when there is no\nqueue. The label is somewhat of a misnomer, because Q1 incorporates all contacts into the\ncalculation, including those that don’t end up in queue. However, this column makes a useful\ncontrast with the next, Q2. Q2: average number of contacts in queue when all agents are busy or when there is a queue. In the example, an average of six contacts are in queue (when there is a queue). Again, this is an\naverage, and there will sometimes be more than six contacts in queue, sometimes fewer. But this\nfigure can provide useful guidance for what to look for when monitoring real-time information,\nand it can also be useful for determining overflow parameters. SL: service level, the percentage of contacts that will be answered (meaning, that will reach\nagents) within the number of seconds you specify (e.g., 82 percent in 20 seconds). OCC: percent agent occupancy. The percentage of time agents will spend handling contacts,\nincluding talk time and after-call work. The rest of the time they are available and waiting for\ncontacts. In the example, occupancy will be 86 percent. Notice the tradeoff: when service level\ngoes up, occupancy goes down. We will discuss this dynamic in Chapter 9."

However, the interpretation takes a bit of thought and application.\nA good question to ask for any service level is, “What happens to the customers that don’t\nget answered in Y seconds?” Programs that calculate delay can be very useful in answering this\nquestion. (The table, Erlang C for Contact Centers—Customer Delay, is also part of ICMI’s\nQueueView program.)\nErlang C for Contact Centers: Customer Delay\nAs you can see, 34 agents will result in a service level of 82 percent of contacts answered in\n20 seconds. But here we get additional insight into what happens to individual customers. Sixty-\nfive customers will wait five seconds or longer. In the next five seconds, seven of those\ncustomers reach agents, so only 58 customers are waiting 10 seconds or longer. In the next five\nseconds, six more customers will reach agents, leaving only 52 callers waiting 15 seconds or\nmore. At this service level, one customer is still waiting three minutes or more (Murphy’s law:"

    "text": "that’s the chairman of the board, testing your service).\nNote an important implication of delay: because of random contact arrival, different\ncustomers have different experiences even though they contacted the organization during the\nsame half hour and even though the contact center may be hitting its target service level. What’s\nthe worst case that your organization is willing to tolerate? This becomes a key question when\nexploring these tradeoffs.\n(Some centers attempt to set two service levels for the same queue: 80 percent of contacts\nhandled within 20 seconds and the rest within 60 seconds. As you can see, that is not possible—\n80/20 and 100/60 are distinctly different service levels, and therefore require different staffing\nlevels to achieve.)\nIf you have never used an Erlang C program, we recommend that you get one and\nexperiment with it. You will learn a lot about staffing dynamics and tradeoffs very quickly by\nusing your own numbers and playing a bit of “what if.” What if handling time goes up? What if\nthe number of contacts goes down? What happens to service level if we have fewer agents than\nrequired? And so forth—have at it!\nSo far, you have calculated staff required to handle a specified mix of inbound contacts that\nmust be handled when they arrive, for one half hour of the day. You will also need to calculate\nbase staff for each half hour of the day and for every unique group of agents—sales, customer\nservice, or other agent groups you have. In step 6 of the planning and management process, we\nwill discuss how to factor in breaks, absenteeism and other variables that keep agents from the\nwork, so that the schedule (step 7) reflects the total staff you need.\nResponse Time\nCalculating staff requirements for response time contacts—workload that does not have to be\nhandled at the time it arrives—is typically based on the centuries-old “units of output” approach.\nHere’s the logic, and let’s use customer email as an example: if you get 60 email messages that\nhave an average handling time of four minutes, that’s four hours of work. One agent working\nnon-stop could handle the load in four hours. If you need to complete the interactions within two\nhours, you will need a minimum of two agents working over a two-hour period.\nIn other words, the workload and your response time objective dictate staff requirements.\nThe basic formula is as shown.\nBasic Response Time Formula"

    "text": "Volume is the quantity of interactions you must handle, AHT is the average amount of time it\ntakes agents to handle them, and response time is the time you have to respond to customers after\nreceiving their messages. Using the formula, you could handle the 60 messages previously\nmentioned in two hours with two agents: 60 ÷ (120 ÷ 4) = 2.\nHere are some things to keep in mind:\n▪ You can slice and dice base staff schedules many ways to achieve your objectives. In fact,\nin the example, you could have 60 agents rush in and handle all 60 interactions just before the\npromised response time and still meet your objective. What you are really doing is looking for an\nefficient way to distribute the workload across your schedules within the promised response\ntime.\n▪ The basic response time formula assumes a “static” amount of work to be completed—in\nother words, you have a defined amount of work that has already arrived and is waiting to be\nprocessed. However, contacts that can be deferred arrive throughout the day in patterns that are\noften similar to service level-type traffic. With 24-hour response time objectives, projected\nworkload can simply be built into the following day’s staffing requirements. But if you have\nmore aggressive response time objectives, you’ll need to look at both on-hand workload and\nprojections by interval to determine staffing requirements.\n▪ When response time objectives are less than an hour, use Erlang C or computer simulation\nto calculate base staff. This would be a queuing and service level scenario, like inbound calls.\n▪ Breaks, absenteeism and other activities that keep agents from the work need to be added to\nbase staff calculations (a step we’ll cover in Chapter 8).\n▪ An “efficiency factor” acknowledges that agents cannot handle one interaction after another\nwith no “breathing” time in between. For example, if you want to build in an efficiency factor\nwith a ceiling of 90 percent, divide base staff calculations by .9 to determine if additional agents\nare required.\nIn short, meeting response time objectives requires:\n▪ Setting response time objectives\n▪ Forecasting these interactions, within timeframes specific enough to calculate base staff\nrequired"

You may be utilizing skills-based routing, sophisticated network environments or\nother configurations that go beyond simple agent groups. Your environment will dictate the\nstaffing methodology that will yield the best results.\nOutbound Contacts\nThere are three general types of outbound contacts. Each has implications for staffing\nrequirements:\n1. OUTBOUND THAT IS A PART OF THE INBOUND WORKLOAD. For example,\ncontacts to an emergency roadside service from stranded customers often involve outbound\ncontacts to arrange towing or repair services. Whether these outbound contacts happen during\ncontacts from customers or immediately following the contacts as part of after-call work, they\nshould be considered part of handling time. As such, they should be included in base staff\nrequirements for the inbound workload.\n2. OUTBOUND CONTACTS THAT ARE SCHEDULED. In many cases, outbound\ncontacts to customers or prospects can be scheduled based on factors such as convenience to\ncustomers, highest probability of making successful connections, etc. Within these blocks of\ntime, outbound contacts can be generated and handled one after another. Base staff requirements\ncan be calculated using traditional response time calculations; for example, a minimum of five\nagents would be required to handle 20 hours’ worth of contacts in four hours’ time. As with other\nresponse time calculations, a reasonable efficiency factor should also be included in the\nassumptions.\n3. OUTBOUND CONTACTS THAT ARE NEITHER A PART OF RANDOMLY\nARRIVING INBOUND WORKLOAD NOR SCHEDULED. In every contact center, there\nare at least some outbound contacts to colleagues or customers that are neither part of the\ninbound load nor specifically scheduled. If significant enough to merit consideration in resource\nrequirements, they can be reflected in step 6, covered in the next chapter.\nSkills-Based Routing\nAvailable in ACD routing systems since the early 1990s, skills-based routing is a powerful\ncapability designed to match each customer with the agent who has the skill set best suited to\nhandle the contact on a real-time basis. It has been a boon to the efficiency and quality of\nservices provided by centers that, by nature, have overlapping groups or complex routing"

As an example,\nthe maps for a technical support center handling calls across Europe might look like this:\nMAP 1\n▪ English-speaking customers who need assistance with tablets\n▪ English-speaking customers who need assistance with laptops\n▪ English-speaking customers who need assistance with printers\n▪ English-speaking customers who need assistance with storage devices\n▪ French-speaking customers who need assistance with tablets\n▪ French-speaking customers who need assistance with laptops"

    "text": "INACCURATE FORECASTS. The inability to forecast accurately for specific types of skill requirements is the Achilles’\nheel of the powerful simulation tools available—and of skills-based routing in general. To anticipate staffing needs, you first\nneed to know how many Spanish-speaking customers you’re going to get between 10:00 and 10:30, how the contact mix will\nchange throughout the day for the expert group handling call types A, B and C, and when your Mandarin Chinese-speaking\nagents will go on break. Accurate forecasting at this level of specificity takes time and effort. If you’re struggling with the detail,\nsee if it’s possible to combine skills (through hiring and training) to form more manageable agent groups. INACCURATE BASE STAFF CALCULATIONS. Whatever staffing method you use (Erlang C, a variation of it, or\nsimulation), a certain amount of trial and error and a healthy dose of intuition and experience are necessary to accurately model\nthe environment. You will need to run through quite a few (sometimes dozens of) “what-if” scenarios to get it right. POOR ASSUMPTIONS AND RATIONALE. Skills-based routing works best in environments that require many skills\nand have many possible combinations of skill sets. It can also help to quickly integrate new agents by initially routing only\nsimple contacts or those of a predefined nature to them. What it can’t do is compensate for poor planning, inadequate training or\npoorly designed information systems. Keep it as simple as possible, and remember that skills-based routing depends on—rather\nthan compensates for the lack of—accurate planning and good processes. NO ROUTING MANAGER/COORDINATOR. If all of this sounds time-consuming, that’s because it is. Even relatively\nsmall contact centers have learned through tough, practical experience that it often takes the equivalent of a full-time person to\nkeep skills-based routing running smoothly. Projecting requirements, assessing current capabilities, updating system\nprogramming and adjusting staffing plans and schedules to accommodate evolving circumstances are ongoing activities. ✽✽✽\nNetwork Environments\nNetwork environments, like skills-based routing, can introduce complex contingencies into\nstaffing calculations. The method you use for calculating staff will depend on the type of\nnetwork environment you have. Your contacts can be routed in different ways. Some examples include:\nVIRTUAL CONTACT CENTER. In a true virtual environment, each contact is routed to\nthe first available agent (or longest-waiting agent). Other routing and queuing contingencies\n(such as skills-based routing) notwithstanding, this environment represents a traditional agent\ngroup regardless of where agents are located (at home, across campus, or on the other side of the\nworld), and Erlang C will generally produce accurate calculations.

As with\nagent groups in a single site, you will forecast the workload you anticipate and run Erlang C\ncalculations for agent groups in each site.\nThere are many variations, and (you’ll find this no surprise by now) I always feel more\ncomfortable when someone shows me the specific parameters that determine how contacts are\nrouted. I remember making a spine-tingling discovery one time with the help of another\nconsultant. By mapping out network routing parameters step-by-step, we isolated why, on rare\noccasions, contacts to a crisis line were ending up in voice mail. It was never supposed to\nhappen, but by going through call flow, step-by-step, we were able to isolate the problem. It was\na good day.\nThe underlying principle is simple: staff appropriately for how and where you intend contacts\nto be handled. And, as with skills-based routing and other alternatives, keep it simple enough so\nthat you and your team can manage it.\nLong Contacts\nContacts that take a relatively long time to handle pose another staffing challenge. Thirty-\nminute reporting periods provide an adequate level of detail and accuracy for most contact\ncenters. However, some centers, particularly those in technical support environments, handle\ncontacts with long average handling times—defined as those that exceed 20 minutes.\nWhen long contacts are not distributed as Erlang C anticipates, they may violate the\nassumptions of the formula. Compounding the problem is the fact that some ACDs count\ncontacts in the period in which they begin, but report average handling time in the period in\nwhich they end. Consequently, reported averages can be skewed.\nIf your AHT approaches or exceeds 20 minutes, you may need to adjust your default\nreporting interval to an hour. Most Erlang C programs will allow you to define the interval you\nwant to use. Alternatively, you can program a simulator to model the mix of contacts you are\nhandling. If, on the other hand, long contacts are not common, but they do occasionally occur,\nyou will need to adjust your statistics (remove them from assumptions) before using your\nhistorical data.\nYou will also need to consider how you manage long contacts. Most technical support\nenvironments have a second tier of support to handle complex issues. You will need to manage\nthe service level for both tiers, or it will suffer in both. But when managed well, this approach\ncan ensure that longer contacts don’t tie up the primary group and cause erratic service levels.\nPeaked Traffic\nPeaked traffic, as discussed in Chapter 3, is a surge beyond random variation within a half\nhour, which poses a unique staffing challenge. For the purposes of this discussion, there are two\ntypes of peaked traffic—the type you can plan for and those incidents that are impossible to\npredict."

Similarly, if a national news program unexpectedly provides your contact\ninformation to the viewing audience as part of a story, you will get unannounced peaked traffic\n—and it will be quite an experience!\nThe problem is, you can’t predict these events, and you’re probably not willing to staff up for\nthem just in case they happen. So staffing for unexpected peaks falls more in the category of\nreal-time management or disaster recovery planning.\nOn the other hand, peaked traffic that you are expecting belongs squarely in the realm of\nplanning. Forecasting, staffing, and scheduling to meet a specified service level still apply.\nHowever, planning must happen at much more detailed periods of time, often in 5- or 10-minute\nincrements. For a given service level, peaked traffic requires more staff than random traffic, and\nagents will have a lower occupancy over a half-hour period.\nMost centers use Erlang C to calculate base staff for predicted peaks. If you expect 200\ncontacts in a 5-minute span, that’s the equivalent of 1,200 contacts in a half hour. If you use an\nErlang C program based on half-hour data, you will assume 1,200 calls for the calculations.\nAlternatively, some staffing programs allow you to specify the timeframe you choose, and can\naccommodate short intervals.\nBut common sense is required.

The last 50 customers will have\nto wait something like two times the average handling time of the contacts.\nThe situation is similar to a bus dropping people off in front of a sports arena. Those reaching\nthe ticket booths first get quick service. For others, wait times can be dramatically different,\ndepending on where they end up in the line. Consequently, how peaked the traffic is (how\nconcentrated it is within a small period of time) and the sequence in which specific customers\narrive will dramatically impact service level. Use common sense as you think through these\nscenarios, and take steps to ensure your customers don’t spend too long in queue.\nChat\nLet’s turn to interactions with multiple back-and-forth messages between a customer and\nagent. Chat is the most common, but the same considerations apply to channels with similar\ncharacteristics (e.g., some text and social media interactions).\nChat is a service-level-oriented contact, and the essential planning steps apply. You can\ndetermine the most conservative (highest) estimate of agents you’ll need by assuming that each\nagent can interact with only one customer at a time, then using Erlang C or simulation to\ncalculate staff requirements based on the usual input—number of contacts, average session\ntransaction time (the equivalent of AHT), and your service level objective. You’ll then adjust for\n(divide by) the average number of concurrent sessions your agents handle. As we’ll see, though,\nworkflow-routing and handling options lead to different staffing requirements.\nTerms\nLet’s review some important terms. The following are definitions that we use and\nrecommend. (Note that, depending on the application, the roles may be reversed—the agent may\nmake an initial request to a customer browsing the organization’s website.)\nSESSION: The whole of the interaction, from hello to goodbye\nEXCHANGE: A part of a session that begins with an inquiry from the customer and\nconcludes with a response from the agent\nSESSION RESPONSE TIME: The time it takes the organization to respond to the initial\nrequest for a session from the customer\nEXCHANGE RESPONSE TIME: The time that elapses between the customer sending a\nquestion or comment and the delivery of the agent’s response\nCUSTOMER RESPONSE TIME: The time it takes the customer to read an agent’s reply\nand send a response\nEXCHANGE HANDLE TIME: The time it takes for the agent to prepare and deliver a\nresponse during an exchange"

They include:\nWHEN WILL YOU NEED FORMAL PLANNING? While some organizations use chat\nextensively, it makes up a relatively small portion of the contact workload for many others. If\nyou’re just starting out, you’ll need to answer a fundamental question: When do you move from\n“educated guessing” to staffing approaches that are more scientific? After all, if you only need\none or two agents handling chat, advanced mathematical approaches won’t yield any more\naccuracy than common sense.\nICMI recommends that a sensible threshold is five—when you need five or more agents\nhandling chat at any one time, a more disciplined approach will begin to pay off. (This is also a\nsensible threshold for social media and other types of interactions.)\nHOW MANY CONCURRENT SESSIONS ARE FEASIBLE? Another key decision is\naround the number of simultaneous sessions you allow agents to handle. Systems can be\nconfigured to enable 16 or more simultaneous sessions per agent—which, of course, is\nimpractical from a human standpoint. The number of maximum concurrent sessions you allow\nwill impact response times, average handling times, customer satisfaction, accuracy, and\nemployee morale.\nTo determine how far beyond one session at a time you can move, basic math comes in\nhandy. Assume that you set the maximum number of concurrent sessions at five (too many for\nmost, but let’s go with it for this example). It’s simple and valuable to develop worst-case\nestimates.\nHere’s the formula: Multiply the maximum number of concurrent sessions you expect by the\naverage exchange handle time. The result will give you an idea of what could happen (worst\ncase) to customer wait times. For example, if five customers initiate an exchange at the same\ntime, and the average exchange handle time is 1.25 minutes, the last customer in line will have to\nwait 6.25 minutes for a response (5 × 1.25). This scenario won’t happen often. But if and when it\ndoes, the delay would be well beyond the expectations of most customers. So, five concurrent\nsessions would be too high for an organization focused on delivering high levels of service.\nMy advice to those just starting out: Go with no more than one or two until you get a better\nread on what’s possible and get the kinks worked out of the system. Overstating the number of\nconcurrent sessions will leave you short-staffed. Consultant Jay Minnucci adds another important\nconsideration: some organizations will only do one chat at a time, for fear of an agent"

    "text": "accidentally providing one customer’s information to another. WHEN DO AGENTS RECEIVE A SESSION? Another decision you must make is when\nan agent will receive a session. If a customer’s initial request is immediately delivered to an\nagent, you can send an automated, personalized greeting from that agent to the customer. If you\ndecide to delay routing to the agent, you will need to deliver either a blank chat box or one with a\ngeneric greeting. Here’s the staffing tradeoff: If you provide the more personalized approach, you will need to\nlive with the chance that you may be tying up an agent too early—some customers will request a\nchat session but then never initiate the exchange, and the agent will be left waiting for a question\nthat never comes. Given this possibility, you will probably want to allow relatively more\nconcurrent sessions per agent than in a scenario where an agent is selected only after an\nexchange is initiated. WHEN DOES A SESSION END? You will also need to define when a session ends. Often,\nthe point of close-out is clear—but sometimes it’s not. For example, customers may get what they need and ignore further attempts at\ncommunication; they may step away from their computer or device; or they might head off to a\ncompetitor’s site. (Chat is often perceived to be less personal than calls, and customers may\napply different rules of courtesy.) While your agent waits for a response, the session is\nconsidered active. So you’ll need to decide on procedures to try to re-engage the customer, and\nwhen the agent can, in effect, “give up” and close the session. Staffing implication: The longer the threshold until close-out, the more time the agent will\nspend waiting for an exchange that may never occur; accordingly, a long threshold would\nsuggest you can allow a relatively higher number of concurrent sessions per agent. In short, staffing for chat revolves more around questions of workflow and technology\napplication than on mathematical calculations. As volumes rise, you’ll need to make decisions in\neach of these areas that are right for your customers. Chat Reports\nAlthough concurrent chat sessions can improve productivity, they can also make reporting\nmore difficult. Consider again the example of five concurrent sessions, where all five customers\ninitiate an exchange at the same time. The last customer served will have to wait 6.25 minutes for\na response—but most of that time was spent on other exchanges with other customers. The\nreporting challenge is accounting for these variables. For example, when a customer initiates an exchange, the reporting system must note how\nmany concurrent exchanges are already in queue for that agent in order to determine the\nexchange handle time. The customer who is fourth in line will wait a total of five minutes for a\nresponse. Divide that wait time by the number of exchanges in queue, and you’ll come up with\nthe exchange handle time of 1.25 minutes (5 ÷ 4)."

Social Media and Text\nFor staffing purposes, there are different types of social media interactions, each requiring a\nspecific approach to resource planning. Text, direct messages through social platforms, or in-app\nmessaging have similar considerations. Here are some common variations:\nREAL-TIME INTERACTIONS, WITH SINGLE RESPONSE. In this setting, the\norganization handles interactions through social media channels as they occur, with one response\ngenerally being sufficient. Typical examples include responding to customers with numbers they\ncan contact, specific email addresses, or links to online resources that provide necessary\ninformation. These are service level-type interactions, and the staffing approach is like that for\ninbound calls. REAL-TIME INTERACTIONS, WITH MULTIPLE EXCHANGES. In this case, the\norganization strives to handle interactions when they are initiated, and the dialogue often\ninvolves multiple back-and-forth messages. Once engaged, customers may continue to ask\nquestions or seek clarification. These are service level-type contacts with staffing considerations\nlike those of chat (see discussion on chat, above). INTERACTIONS THAT CAN BE DEFERRED. This approach involves addressing\ninquires or issues that do not require an immediate response. Common examples include\nresponding to general inquiries posted through social media sites, or sending responses, FAQ\ndocuments, or relevant links that address questions posted in forums. In this scenario, staffing is\nresponse time-oriented, like that for email or scheduled outbound contacts. INTERNAL INTERACTIONS. The impact of internal collaboration tools on staffing\nrequirements must be considered in context. If internal communication is necessitated by (and\nhappens while) handling customer interactions, the time required should be reflected realistically\nin the average handling time associated with those contacts. On the other hand, internal\ncommunication that is not directly associated with handling customer contacts (e.g., for internal\nprojects or, simply, the everyday communication that is part of a normal work environment)\nshould at least be accounted for in overall schedule requirements (see Chapter 8). Note that different systems will deliver social media interactions to agents in different ways. For example, some present social interactions in email-like format. That’s fine. Just remember,\nit’s not email in the usual sense, and staffing requirements should be driven by whether the work\nneeds to happen at the time and whether it involves multiple exchanges. Considerations for text messages (those that involve agents) are similar—do they occur at the\ntime of initial inquiry (requiring a service level approach) or can they happen later (response\ntime)?"

Note: after-call work is already\nincluded in base staff calculations (as part of average handling time) so it should not be included\nin RSF factor calculations.\nIn many contact centers, RSF ebbs and flows in the 1.1 to 1.5 range throughout the day,\nmeaning that a minimum of 10 percent to 50 percent additional staff are required on schedule,\ncompared to base staff (agents handling the workload). But don’t trust rules of thumb: You will\nneed to produce your own calculations. If activities not related to the workload are significant,\nRSF can be as high as 2.0, meaning that you’ll need to schedule two people for each agent\nrequired. This is fairly common in some technical support environments that require more\nextensive offline research.\nImproving Accuracy\nLarger centers will pick up accuracy by going through this planning step in 15-minute\nincrements. In smaller centers, half-hour periods are sufficient, but you should use numbers that\nare conservative (err on the side of overstaffing). For example, if you have two people on break\nthe first 15 minutes of the half hour, and four on break in the second half of the period, use four\nin the calculations.\nIf you calculated staff for hour increments due to long calls (as discussed in Chapter 6), you\ncan also generally calculate RSF by hour, since long contacts tend to impact scheduled breaks\nand lunch. If you find that hours are not picking up the activity accurately, drop to half-hour\nincrements.\nIf you are handling peaked traffic, you can usually use half-hour or 15-minute increments for\nRSF even though you calculated base staff for even shorter periods. (Naturally, plan any\nactivities that are flexible around the inbound peaks.)\nShrinkage or Rostered Staff Factor?\nSome use the terms rostered staff factor (RSF) and shrinkage interchangeably to refer to the"

There’s nothing wrong with that, as long as it’s understood that the terms refer to the\noverall concept of needing more staff on schedule than the base staff required to handle the\nworkload.\nOthers use the terms more specifically—nothing wrong with that either, as long as the\ncontext is understood. When differentiated—and it’s subtle—shrinkage refers to how much loss\n(shrinkage) there is between scheduled staff and base staff, while rostered staff factor looks at\nhow much needs to be added to base staff required to reach schedule requirements.\nWhat’s not subtle is how the calculations for each are used when they are differentiated in\nthis way. Consider an example where base staff is 40 and 10 agents will be involved in other\nactivities. The schedule requirement is 50 agents.\nThe RSF is 50/40, or 1.25\nApplication: 40 × 1.25 = 50 agents\n(or)\nThe shrinkage (loss) = 10/50, or 20%\nApplication: 40 ÷ (1 - 20%) = 50 agents\nUh oh … you can probably see what’s coming here. Some mistakenly apply shrinkage in\nplace of what should be RSF and end up with too few scheduled agents; others use RSF in place\nof what should be shrinkage and end up with too many scheduled agents.\nInvestment analysts often have to remind clients of a similar principle in the world of\nfinance. If a $5,000 investment drops by 20 percent, the new balance is $4,000; $4,000 would\nneed to grow by 25 percent (4,000 × 1.25) to again reach $5,000. Many contact center managers\nhave found themselves in a similar education process: “Yes, scheduled staff shrinks by 20\npercent, which is why we need 25 percent additional staff above base staff requirements for that\nincrement!”\nIn that respect, RSF has some advantages—it’s easier to explain. Correctly applying either\nmethod at the interval level will lead you to the same answers. However, you have to take\nshrinkage a step further to calculate staff required, while RSF provides requirements more\ndirectly.\nThe RSF methodology also tends to fit nicely into the logical progression of planning:\ncalculate staff and supporting resources (steps 4 and 5), determine and apply RSF (step 6), and\norganize schedules (step 7). Shrinkage tends to take a more circuitous route, starting with\nschedules (step 7), then determining loss or shrinkage (step 6), then applying the formula to base\nstaff and supporting resources (steps 4 and 5), all to get back to schedule requirements (step 7).\nIt’s a small but important point, and I do prefer the RSF approach when explaining these\nprinciples to others."

(I run into people who have been in the profession\nfor years and have never heard of RSF.) And it’s used more broadly in other business settings,\nsuch as where grocers must account for inventory loss caused by damage or food expiration.\nFinally, the time horizon you are considering may impact the approach you use. As described\nhere, RSF and shrinkage are for near- and medium-term scheduling purposes. When we look at a\nlonger planning horizon, we’ll use a shrinkage-like approach to determine full-time equivalent\nrequirements (Chapter 10). But caution is in order: Any mismatch of time—i.e., taking a\ncalculation for shrinkage or RSF determined over a broader timeframe, and applying it to smaller\nincrements—simply doesn’t work.\nThere are different ways to get from point A to point B. When used correctly and in the right\ncontext, both shrinkage and RSF lead to the same answer.\n✽✽✽\nCAN YOU SKIP STEP 6?\nWhy bother with RSF—step 6 in the planning process—if you know how many staff you will need simply by adding the\ncolumns together? Better yet, why bother with any of it, if your scheduling software accounts for these sorts of things? Can you\ncalculate base staff requirements, then jump right into scheduling—skipping step 6 altogether?\nWith workforce management systems, you can, in a sense, do just that. After calculating base staff requirements, you will\nbegin building schedules. And yes, they will account for and include breaks, holidays, training and any other variables you enter.\nBut step 6 is still important, for several reasons:\n▪ Simply understanding the principle is key to understanding the spread between base staff and schedule requirements. And\nyou’ll need to explain this issue to others in various planning and budgeting settings.\n▪ There will be times when you’ll want to model the schedule requirements for different workload scenarios, without\nlaboring though the minutia of adding up individual components. There’s nothing that beats the speed and accuracy of having a\nset of factors.\n▪ Because it is a ratio, RSF can be easily tracked and graphed, enabling you to see relative trends and identify improvement\nopportunities. That is much more difficult when looking at a full-blown schedule.\n✽✽✽\nA Prerequisite to Effective Budgets and Schedules\nFrankly, the whole notion of rostered staff factor raises lots of questions in the budgeting\nprocess—and understandably so.

Even small changes may\nprovide better coverage or make scheduling easier or more acceptable to agents. Like any aspect\nof planning, examine how accurate your predictions are compared to actual results, and adjust\naccordingly.\nAfter you have calculated RSF, you know your staffing requirements accurately down to\nspecific times of day. The next challenge is to identify scheduling alternatives and parameters so\nthat you can organize schedules that closely match staffing requirements.\nScheduling Alternatives\nConsidering that staffing needs fluctuate significantly throughout the day, month, and year,\nwhat can you do to ensure you have an adequate number of people in place without being\noverstaffed much of the time? After all, few would want to work half-hour shifts.\nFortunately, quite a few alternatives exist and we’ll summarize many of them here. Not all\nwill be feasible for you. This aspect of planning is creative—it involves putting all options on the\ntable, identifying the scheduling approaches that could work in your environment, and then\nmaking a decision on those that you will use.\nUSE HIRING TO YOUR ADVANTAGE. Important criteria when hiring new agents\nshould be the hours and days they, in general can be available to work.\nUTILIZE CONVENTIONAL SHIFTS. Most organizations have a core group of agents\nwho work a traditional five-day week with shifts during normal hours (e.g., 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).\nThat’s just fine, assuming there are additional scheduling options to address variability in\nworkload within and beyond these hours."

Even\nslight changes to when these activities are scheduled can mean that more people are handling\ncontacts at just the right times. That can make a big difference (see Chapter 9). Some managers\nfind that scheduling breaks and lunches on the 5-minute mark (e.g., 10:05, 10:10) helps—they\nwon’t happen that precisely in reality, but this can lessen the impact of simultaneous events.\nWithin reason, this alternative is available to any organization.\nSTAGGER SHIFTS. For example, one shift begins at 7 a.m., the next at 7:30 a.m., the next\nat 8 a.m., etc., until the center is fully staffed for the busy mid-morning traffic. This is a common\nand effective approach. Be sure to tweak these shifts as necessary to account for changes in\nworkload patterns.\nOFFER CONCENTRATED SHIFTS. Given the choice, some employees will opt to work\nfewer days with more hours per day, while others would rather work fewer hours in a day, even\nif that means a six- or seven-day workweek. But keep in mind that not all agents can perform at\nhigh levels throughout extended shifts.\nUSE AN ENVELOPE STRATEGY. With more types of work to handle in today’s\nenvironment, many contact centers are using an “envelope” strategy (see figure)—meaning\nthere’s a larger envelope of staff scheduled than generally required by customer contacts alone.\nThis approach recognizes that some types of work have to be handled at specific times of the\nday, and other types of work allow more flexibility.

No additional training is required, and many agents will volunteer for\nthe extra work. However, overtime can be expensive as an ongoing strategy and, once again,\nthere is the question of whether or not agents can sustain high performance over longer shifts.\nGIVE AGENTS THE OPTION TO GO HOME WITHOUT PAY. Many organizations\nprovide LWOP (leave without pay, pronounced “el-wop”) or VTO (voluntary time off) when\nworkloads slow down. (This is also common outside of contact centers, such as in warehouse\nfacilities). There are agents willing to take you up on it, but you’ll learn with some experience\nhow practical this approach is.\nSCHEDULE PART-TIMERS.

But\nwhen available and feasible, this is a popular and common approach.

This approach takes the reinforcement method to the larger\norganization, where employees from other areas help handle customer services as needed. To\nimplement this alternative successfully, you’ll need to address training, scheduling, pay and\ncultural issues. ARRANGE FOR SOME AGENTS TO BE ON CALL. Although this option is impractical\nfor many, it can work in situations where events cannot be precisely predicted (e.g., retailers\nduring the initial days of a new promotion). Typically, for it to be effective, agents must be\nequipped to work from home. OFFER SPLIT SHIFTS. Granted, split shifts—where agents work a partial shift, take part\nof the day off, then return later to finish their shifts—are not common. We’ve seen them in\nsituations where university students are employed and work around class schedules. But don’t\ncount this alternative out in other settings. A group of full-time employees in one of MetLife’s\ncontact centers once volunteered to work in the mornings and then come back for the less\npopular evening shift. They were happy to have some free midday time for errands and leisure\nactivities. GET HELP FROM AN OUTSOURCER. Today, outsourcers of all types and capabilities\nare available. The better among them can handle complex contacts, and many focus on specific\nindustries, languages, and contact channels. With some, the capacity to quickly ramp up as\nworkloads dictate is a key advantage. COLLABORATE WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. Some centers have formed\nsuccessful staffing alliances with other organizations. With different seasonality patterns, two\ncenters can “lend” agents to one another to help each company effectively handle peak contact\nperiods and minimize costs that would be incurred to hire and train temporary staff. While not a\ncommon practice, we have seen organizations from diverse industries use this staff-sharing\napproach successfully. ESTABLISH HOME-BASED AGENTS. This is not a scheduling alternative per se, but it\ncan make unpopular shifts more tolerable and allow agents to handle contacts on short notice. Numerous organizations have successfully implemented work-at-home agent programs,\nbenefiting not only from enhanced scheduling flexibility but also increased productivity and\nagent retention. Some companies have arranged for the majority of contact center staff to be\nhome agents. SACRIFICE SERVICE LEVEL FOR A PLANNED PERIOD OF TIME. It may be\nunrealistic for some customer service or technical support centers to meet service level (and\nresponse time) objectives during the initial weeks of a new product introduction or during the\nbusiest season.

Here are some\nexamples:\n▪ JetBlue, American Express, and Omni Hotels and Resorts are among the many organizations using at-home agents\nextensively, which opens up many flexible scheduling alternatives. Home-agent programs have skyrocketed in the last decade,\nenabled by advancements in technologies, the desirability of flexible work arrangements (which increases the pool of qualified\nstaff), disaster backup considerations (e.g., inclement weather), and cost efficiencies.\n▪ The healthcare industry sees workload spikes each year during open enrollment, and an off-season period that can be very\nslow. This, coupled with annual training periods of up to 12 weeks, makes staffing a challenge. Humana, UnitedHealthcare and\nothers in the space are responding with combinations of a teacher model (i.e., off some of the summer), voluntary time off, and\nreduced shifts during the off-peak.\n▪ Agents with U.S. Bancorp Fund Services can change their shift pattern preferences weekly. For example, they can select a\nstandard 5×8 shift (five days, eight hours); 4×10, which provides an extra day off; 10, 10, 8, 8, 4, which provides a half day off;\nor others. Similarly, Vegas.com, Zappos and others are enabling agents to schedule their own shifts (often through mobile apps)\naround blocks of time that match forecasted requirements. As the award-winning U.S. Bancorp team advises, take a look at your\nbusiness needs and then get creative—your business can benefit as much as your agents.\nMy favorite long-running example is The Vanguard Group, the financial services company that pioneered a “SWAT team”\nthat they call their Swiss Army. Employees up to and including (in his time) the late founder and former CEO, John C. Bogle,\nhave helped handle customer interactions. Yes, that helps with the workload—and it’s also a powerful reinforcement of what\nmatters (being there for customers).\n✽✽✽\nSometimes I hear defeatist attitudes related to staffing and scheduling: “Hey, they’re going to\ngive us what they are going to give us.” (See chart, Someone Who Has Given Up.)

    "text": "Putting the Pieces Together\nScheduling is, by nature, an iterative process. Effective scheduling will always involve a\ncertain amount of trial and error. As you identify scheduling alternatives, there are a number of\nimportant considerations:\nAGENT PREFERENCES. If you involve agents in identifying scheduling possibilities up\nfront, they will often generate ideas you didn’t consider and will better accept and adhere to the\nschedules that are produced. Scheduling modules that provide the ability for agents to directly\ncreate, swap and adjust schedules (within established parameters) are popular with agents and\nworkforce managers alike. And education on the implications of service level, quality, and the\nimpact of each person helps enormously (see The Power of One, Chapter 9).\nAGENT GROUP STRUCTURE AND CHANNEL MIX. How specialized are your skill\nrequirements? Some centers can’t say with precision where contacts go because their skills- or\ncontingency-based routing environments are so complex. Keep your routing contingencies\nsimple enough to manage. Similarly, what’s your channel mix, and how does that (and should\nthat) impact your agent group structure? With these issues in mind, invest the time necessary to\nforecast, staff and schedule for the unique mix of contacts your center is handling.\nSCHEDULE HORIZON. How far in advance will you determine schedules (the schedule\nhorizon)? If you schedule further out, say for two or three months from now, your schedules will\nbe less efficient. They will be locked in place, even if the workloads deviate from the forecast.\nBut a big plus is that they will be more agreeable to your staff, who prefer to know their work\nschedules well in advance. On the other hand, if you use a shorter timeframe, the scheduling\nprocess will be less popular with agents, but schedules will likely be more accurate. This issue is\na balancing act."

If you are a union-based shop, an open, collaborative\nenvironment with union representatives—as well as educating all involved on the principles\ncovered in Chapters 7 through 9—can help immensely.\nScheduling software can be a big help in shuffling the pieces and generating schedules\naccording to the parameters you establish. Conversely, it can produce schedules that people will\nlook at and say, “Are you kidding?

Secrets to Better Scheduling Results\nScheduling is a process that can be learned and continuously improved. You get better at it\nwith practice! We’ve found that organizations getting the best results take steps beyond the mechanics of\ncalculating required staff and putting schedules together. Here are five of their practices. 1. CLARIFY YOUR ORGANIZATION’S VALUES. This involves a dialogue and set of\ndecisions with the organization’s senior-level management around key questions: What is the\ncontact center’s mission? How committed are you to providing good service even when the\nforecasts may be uncertain? What are your priorities—which activities get done first? What\nalternatives exist to maintain consistent service levels, from scheduling options to backup from\nother departments or outside help? Be ready for these discussions. They are opportunities to clarify direction and make a case\nfor the resources and support that the contact center requires. 2. MODEL DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. Modeling, or periodically creating test schedules\nwith different sets of variables, can be a real eye-opener, leading to different possibilities and\nsolutions. What’s the impact of changing contact-routing alternatives? Agent group structure? Schedule horizon? Training and meeting schedules? Shifts? While modeling takes time—you’re basically having a person or team produce example\nschedules under different parameters—you’ll get this investment back in multiples in the form of\nbetter decisions that come from an understanding of tradeoffs and points of leverage. Scheduling\nsoftware can be a big help in this effort, particularly in larger or more complex centers. 3. ENSURE THAT ALL ACTIVITIES ARE INCLUDED. Too often, contact centers\nhave extra work outside of the schedule that is unaccounted for but that exacts a heavy price on\nmorale and quality when it’s ignored for too long (e.g., unfinished projects, administrative work,\nreading updates, coaching sessions, and case work). Take an inventory of activities that is as\ncomprehensive and specific as possible. 4. RESOLVE THE “POWER STRUGGLES.” If “power struggle” sounds a bit dramatic,\nyou ought to see some of the challenges those in forecasting and scheduling roles have\nencountered: requests from other areas preempting schedules, unplanned marketing campaigns,\nunannounced schedule exceptions among agent teams, and unclear lines of authority between\nsupervisors and workforce planners. These challenges are not insurmountable—unless they go\nunaddressed. Educating supervisors and agents on the basics of forecasting and scheduling is an\nimportant part of the solution! 5. ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS IS FLEXIBLE AND INCLUSIVE. Effective\nscheduling will always involve a certain amount of trial and error."

Misunderstanding or ignoring these principles leads to inconsistent service,\ndemoralized employees, excessive costs, and poor customer experiences.\nSix “immutable laws” are at work in any center that handles inbound contacts. They are\nimmutable because they always have been and always will be true. All are driven or at least\ninfluenced by random contact arrival (see Chapter 3).\nLet’s take a look at each. Along the way, I’ll offer some tips on bringing your team up to\nspeed and ensuring that these immutable laws are working for (not against) your efforts.\n1. When Service Level Goes Up, Occupancy Goes Down\nAs discussed in Chapter 4, service level is expressed as “X percent of contacts answered in Y\nseconds.” Occupancy is the percentage of time during an interval that agents who are signed in\nand handling the workload are actually handling contacts. The inverse of occupancy is the time\nthat agents are waiting to handle contacts.\nAs the following table illustrates, a service level of 80 percent of contacts answered in 20\nseconds (82/20 in this scenario) equates to an occupancy of 86 percent for that workload. If\nservice level drops to 24 percent answered in 20 seconds, occupancy goes up to 97 percent."

    "text": "The relationship between occupancy and service level is often misunderstood. The incorrect\nlogic goes something like, “If agents really dig in, service level will go up and so will their\noccupancy.” In reality, if occupancy is high, it is because agents are working on one contact after\nanother, with little or no wait in between. Contacts are stacked up in queue and service level is\nlow. In the worst scenario, occupancy is 100 percent because all customers spend at least some\ntime in queue and agents have no breathing room between contacts.\nWhen service level goes up, occupancy goes down (see figure, Contacts Per Agents Versus\nService Level). Therefore, the average contacts handled per agent will also go down. Setting\nstandards on number of contacts handled is not recommended, because agents can’t directly\ncontrol occupancy. Doing so would also conflict with an important objective: ensure that enough\nagents are available to handle contacts so that your service level objectives are achieved. (We\nwill discuss individual performance standards in Chapter 14.)"

Jen, Ben, and Mary are three of 32 agents plugged in and taking calls.\nStaffing calculations (see table above) predict the average occupancy for the half hour for 32\nagents will be 91 percent and service level will be just above 60 percent answered in 20 seconds.\nThis is what these three agents may be thinking:\nJen: Whew!

When adherence to schedule improves,\noccupancy goes down. Why? Because when agents are available to handle more contacts, service\nlevel will go up. And when service level goes up, occupancy goes down. This means that if your\nagents adhere to their schedules, they don’t have to work as hard. This is an important concept\nfor everyone to understand.\nWhen adherence to schedule improves (goes up), occupancy goes down.\nThe terms adherence to schedule and occupancy are often incorrectly used interchangeably.\nThey not only mean different things, they move in opposite directions.

It can be defined this way: when successive individual agents are assigned to a given\nworkload, the incremental improvements in service level that can be attributed to each additional\nagent will eventually decline.\nThe Law of Diminishing Returns figure is based on Erlang C data from the staffing table at\nthe beginning of this chapter. It shows that 30 agents at the given call load will provide a service\nlevel of 24 percent in 20 seconds. Keep in mind, these numbers will not be exact—at that low of\na service level, many of the contacts will abandon (not get answered at all). But the exact results\naside, service level will be poor.\nWith 31 agents, things improve dramatically, as service level jumps to 45 percent. Adding\none more person yields another big improvement. In fact, adding only four or five people takes\nservice level from the depths to something respectable. That means an associated drop in average\nspeed of answer (ASA) and trunk load.\nThe same principle is true for larger groups, as the next table shows. Each person has a\nsignificant positive impact on the queue when service level is low, even in groups that are much\nlarger."

Think of what a stalled car blocking just one lane can quickly do to a busy\nexpressway.\nThe Power of One\nThe power of one is among the most important principles to introduce to new hires and\nreinforce with experienced agents. While we know the impact each agent has on individual\ncustomers and the subsequent publicity (good or bad) that can come from those experiences, the\npower of one refers more specifically to queues and wait times.\nThe central theme that shapes contact center operations is that they are dynamic; workloads\narrive randomly in any center that handles customer-initiated contacts. This, coupled with the\nreality of how queues behave, means that agents who are helping manage the workload affect\nservice level—in a good way—far more than they may realize."

Think\nthrough how you could approach them with your team.\n▪ Educate each person on how much impact he or she has on the queue—and incorporate\nthese or similar scenarios into training.\n▪ Develop reasonable expectations for adherence to schedules, and explain the reasoning\nbehind those expectations.\n▪ Educate everyone on the core steps involved in forecasting and resource planning, so that\nthey know how schedules are produced and where they come from.\n▪ Provide real-time queue information to agents on readerboards, desktops or phones. (We’ll\ndiscuss how to use this information in Chapter 11.)\n▪ Develop appropriate priorities for the full range of tasks that your team handles and\nguidelines for how to respond to evolving conditions.\n✽✽✽\nUNDERSTANDING HOW CONTACT CENTERS BEHAVE\nThe central reality that shapes contact center operations is that they are dynamic in the truest sense. Because of the randomly\narriving nature of customer contacts, each person has a big impact on the organization’s responsiveness. That, in turn, is an\nimportant enabler to delivering great customer experiences, boosting loyalty and contributing to successful business results.\nA notable trend among the most effective contact centers is to educate their entire teams (agents, supervisors, managers and\nanalysts, as well as colleagues from across their organizations) on contact center dynamics, the power of one, and the value the\norganization delivers when strong cross-functional support is in place. American Express, USAA, and FedEx are just a few\nexamples of highly rated companies that have made this an ongoing priority.\nProviding an understanding of how contact centers behave is a gift to those who work in or support them. It just makes good\nsense.\n✽✽✽\n3. Larger Groups Are More Efficient\nAverage group productivity (contacts that a group handles) is not a constant factor. Instead,\nit’s constantly fluctuating as the workload ebbs and flows. Even when you maintain a consistent\nservice level through good planning and on-target scheduling; you’ll find that average\nproductivity is relatively lower at lower volumes and relatively higher at higher workloads.\nBecause the number of contacts is changing throughout the day, so is average group productivity.\nWhy? Mathematically, larger groups of agents are more efficient than smaller groups, at the\nsame service level. Therefore, larger groups assigned to heavy mid-morning traffic will be more"

Attempting to compare groups or sites in a multi-site\nenvironment may also be misleading (the exception would be a network that finds the longest-\nwaiting agent, a true virtual contact center).\nDespite mathematical efficiencies, there is a point where groups become so large that\noccupancy becomes too high for agents. Some managers believe that the number of agents in a\nsingle group should be limited to 125 to 150 people. However, plenty of centers have much\nlarger agent groups (the U.S. Social Security Administration, Centrelink Australia, China Mobile\nand others have hundreds or even thousands of agents in a single agent group)."

The Powerful Pooling Principle\nThe powerful pooling principle is a mathematical fact that goes like this: any movement in\nthe direction of consolidation of resources will result in improved traffic-carrying efficiency.\nConversely, any movement away from consolidation of resources will result in reduced traffic-\ncarrying efficiency. Put more simply, if you take several small, specialized agent groups, and\neffectively cross-train them and put them into a single group, you’ll have a more efficient\nenvironment.\n✽✽✽\nThe Powerful Pooling Principle\n▪ Handle more contacts, at the same service level, with the same number of agents"

But only 124 agents, not 150, are\nnecessary to handle a load 10 times as large.\nThe pooling principle should be a consideration from the highest levels of strategic planning\n(How many centers should you have? How should agent groups be designed?), down to more\ntactical decisions related to real-time adjustments or how to best invest training time and\nresources.\nIn one sense, pooling resources is at the heart of what ACDs and networks do. A clear trend\nin recent years, though, is the recognition that customers often have different needs and\nexpectations, and that different agents with a mix of aptitudes and skills are required. Powerful\ncapabilities, such as skills-based routing, give us the means to route and handle contacts based on\nmyriad criteria (see Chapter 7).\nCan you have specialization without forgoing the benefits of the powerful pooling principle?\nIt depends. Skills-based routing can boost efficiency by getting contacts to the agents best suited\nto handle them. But when not managed well, or when overused, the number of contingencies can\nmultiply beyond your management team’s ability to understand and manage them. The interplay\ncan become stupefying. And the whole notion of agent groups and pooling begins to erode.\nWhen skills and routing priorities become too complex, related dangers begin to emerge.\nDoug Casterton, Head of Global Workforce Planning and Scheduling for Trip Advisor in\nOxford, U.K., warns of the “eversinking queue.” When skill priorities have been set a different\nlevel, “it’s possible for the higher priority contacts to jump the queue, and if you have not\ncorrectly staffed, the lower priority contacts may never actually reach an agent.”\nAs real and pervasive as the pooling principle is, it is not an all-or-nothing proposition.

These and other steps you can take to effectively broaden the work types\nagents handle will, by definition, boost efficiencies.\n5. Add Staff and ASA Goes Down\nAnyone who has ever waited in line for anything knows that if there were a few more\ntollbooths, open check-out aisles, or people behind the counter, the line wouldn’t be so long!\nAnd when someone behind the counter gets reassigned to another task or goes on break, the wait\nincreases (this happens anytime I enter a physical line—perhaps it’s a cosmic joke on those of us\nwho study queues).\nThe same principle is at work in contact centers. When more agents are plugged in and\nhandling contacts, assuming they are trained to do so proficiently, the queue will be shorter.\nFewer agents means a longer queue. This principle leads to the next immutable law.\n6. Add Staff and Trunk Load Goes Down\nWhen more agents are assigned to a given workload, trunk load (the load on the network that\nhandles voice and data) goes down. The converse is also true: when fewer agents are available to\nhandle a given workload, trunk load goes up because the delay increases (see discussion on\ntrunks, Chapter 7).\nEach customer connected to your system is part of the workload, whether they are talking to\nan agent or waiting in queue. If you have toll-free service (or any other service that charges a\nusage fee), you are paying for this time. Telecommunications costs are inextricably wrapped in\nstaffing issues. If service level is continually low, the costs of network services will escalate.\nThe following example illustrates the tradeoffs between staffing levels and service level,\naverage speed of answer, occupancy, and trunk load. Recall from Chapter 7 that trunk load\nrepresents how much time (in hours) customers are queued for and/or talking to agents in a\nparticular group over the equivalent of an hour. Staff is calculated for a half hour’s traffic, but the\ntrunk load is converted to an hour’s traffic (“erlangs”) simply because telecom managers\nuniversally use hour increments for engineering and management purposes."

Using the scenario in the table, assume that you have 46 agents handling contacts\nand, therefore, will be able to achieve a service level of 80/20. Here’s how the calculations\nproduced an estimated 37.6 hours on the trunks:\n▪ First, you can see that customers will be queued for agents an average of 13 seconds (ASA)\nand will be connected to agents an average of 180 seconds (average talk time), for a total of 193\nseconds. The 180 seconds represents the forecast for what average talk time will likely be; the 13\nseconds ASA comes from the Erlang C calculation.\n▪ Because the table provides volume for a half hour, double 350 contacts to assume 700\ncontacts in an hour.\n▪ Because the 700 calls spend an average 193 seconds queuing for and connected to agents,\nthe trunk load in seconds is 135,100 seconds (700 contacts × 193 seconds).\n▪ Finally, because trunk load is presented in erlangs (hours of traffic over the course of an\nhour), divide 135,100 by 3,600 (the number of seconds in an hour) and you come up with 37.6\nhours. To use the correct telecom lingo, you’ll have the equivalent of 37.6 erlangs of traffic on\nthe trunks for this agent group during this time period.

Glance through\nthe table, and you’ll see that if 50 agents are handling calls, ASA will be a projected 3 seconds. If\n42 agents are handling calls, ASA will be a projected 144 seconds. In short, the number of agents\nhandling work determines the average delay, which is a key variable in trunk load and,\naccordingly, in what you pay for toll-free services.\nThe Impact of Staff on Toll-Free Costs\nAs you decide on service levels and how to allocate budgets, you should think about network\ncosts, too. All other things being equal, if your service level is low, adding an agent will often\nbring total costs down because network costs will drop dramatically.\nThe staff versus toll-free costs tradeoff used to be much more dramatic. In many parts of the\nworld, toll-free costs are just pennies (or less) a minute. Toll-free service used to be much more\nexpensive to organizations (15 cents per minute or higher). So, improving service level meant\nhuge drops in network costs, often producing savings that far surpassed the cost of adding staff.\nWith today’s far lower network costs, the tradeoff is less significant.\nHowever, you still have expense for carrying the traffic, and there are also costs related to\nports, IVR capacity, maintenance, taxes, and other budgetary line items. Delay takes resources\nand it is not free. Assessing the impact on network costs underscores the importance of\nconsidering both agent and network costs together. Improving service level will save money on\nnetwork services; these savings should be factored into predictions of overall costs.\nThe Cost of Delay\nThe direct expense of putting customers in queue is called the “cost of delay.” It is expressed\nin terms of how much you pay for toll-free service each day (or month, hour, or half hour) just\nfor customers to wait in queue until they reach an agent.\nYou may want to plot the cost of delay. It’s simple. First, take the total delay for the day, as\nreported by your ACD, and convert that into minutes or hours. Next, multiply the minutes or\nhours of delay by the average per-minute or per-hour cost of your toll-free service. Then add that\nfigure to a graph that illustrates these costs (see example)."

Here’s a list of 10\n“must knows” that I believe are a good starting point for understanding the nature of contact\ncenters. I encourage you to take stock of these and look for ways to boost your senior\nmanagement’s understanding.\n1. CONTACT CENTERS ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO THE\nORGANIZATION’S SUCCESS. They are strategic assets, not\nclerical/administrative/backroom operations. They are hubs of communication—vital to\nunderstanding and serving diverse customers, capturing marketplace intelligence, and harnessing\nthe voice of the customer to improve products and services.\n2. CONTACTS “BUNCH UP.” In any center that handles at least some inbound work, the\nworkflow dynamics are unique (see Chapter 3). Customers decide when and how they will\ncontact the organization, and the resulting work will not arrive in a nice, even flow. Staffing and\nproductivity issues must be considered in that context (see Chapters 7 and 14).\n3. THERE’S GENERALLY NO INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR ACCESSIBILITY.

    "text": "organizations will have different costs, customers and brand objectives. However, there are\nobjectives that will make sense for your organization—that fit your customers’ needs and your\norganization’s brand (Chapter 4). 4. THERE’S A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN RESOURCES AND RESULTS. You may\nneed 36 people handling contacts to achieve a service level of 90 percent answer in 20 seconds,\ngiven your customer workload. It’s not going to work if you have only 25 people and are told to\nhit a 90/20 service level. And scrimping on staffing is expensive, leading to high agent\noccupancy, burnout and turnover, unhappy customers, poor word of mouth, and other direct and\nindirect costs (Chapters 7, 9 and 13). 5. WHEN SERVICE LEVEL IMPROVES, “PRODUCTIVITY” DECLINES. Productivity is often measured as contacts handled or occupancy. (This is a perspective I hope to\nhelp change; see Chapter 14.) As discussed in Chapter 9, when service level goes up, occupancy\ngoes down, as does the average number of contacts handled per agent. Translation: in any center\nthat is achieving a good service level, agents will be waiting (idle) some of the time, given the\nnature of random contact arrival (Chapter 9). 6. YOU WILL NEED TO SCHEDULE MORE STAFF THAN BASE STAFF\nREQUIRED. Schedules should realistically reflect the many things that can keep agents from\nhandling contacts, such as training, breaks, holidays, collateral or ancillary work and other\ndiversions (see Chapter 8). In many organizations, these factors are becoming more prevalent, as\nthe increasingly complex environment requires more time for training, research, and other\nactivities. 7. SUMMARY REPORTS DON’T GIVE AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF WHAT’S\nREALLY HAPPENING. Reports that show averages of activity may suggest that performance\nis just fine, yet they may be concealing serious problem areas. Those producing and interpreting\ndata must know what they’re really looking at (see discussions in this chapter and Chapters 4 and\n12). 8. QUALITY AND SERVICE LEVEL WORK TOGETHER. Though they are sometimes\npresented as tradeoffs, service level is inextricably tied to getting contacts into the center and\nhandled in a quality fashion. And better quality is the key to a better service level, by upping\nfirst-contact resolution, reducing repeat contacts, and picking up intelligence (“knowledge”) that\nhelps improve processes, products, and services across the organization (Chapters 12, 13). 9. CONTACT CENTERS ARE BECOMING MORE COMPLEX. Traditional\ntransaction-oriented centers have evolved into more dynamic and holistic operations that\ncontribute to and require the support of departments across the organization. Social media,\nomnichannel, multi-generational customers, competition, AI-driven self-serve technologies that\nhandle more routine activities, and other trends are raising the bar (see Chapters 2 and 15). 10.

An\nignition switch fault had led to more than 100 deaths and the recall of more than 2.6 million vehicles. She took accountability,\nmet with affected families, set up a compensation fund, and communicated directly and honestly with employees. “Employees\nsaw Barra in call centers taking calls and listening in, and speaking with employees,” recounts Jeanne Bliss in her insightful\nbook, Would You Do That to Your Mother. “Barra’s courage gave her entire company the values they are to uphold, when unity\nand solidarity in her organization mattered the most.” (See Chapter 15, GM Leverages AI in Social Customer Care.)\n✽✽✽\nPrinciples of Effective Budgeting\nEnsuring that you’re getting necessary resources is an important part of enabling the contact\ncenter’s strategic potential. That, of course, requires an effective budget—and a clear\nunderstanding of what the returns on those investments should be. A budget is simply a summary of proposed or agreed-upon expenditures (costs) for a given\nperiod of time, for specified purposes. Sounds easy enough. But the process of putting together a\nbudget is often seen as tedious, time-consuming and, some say, a distraction from “more\nimportant management responsibilities.” However, don’t forget the outcome of this much-\nmaligned process: the funding the contact center needs to accomplish its mission and potential. Here are the essential principles I’ve uncovered in analyzing and working with contact\ncenters that consistently get the right amount of funding, at the right times, for the right things:\nVIEW THE BUDGET AS MUCH MORE THAN A DOCUMENT."

I’ve also seen\npowerful (and positive) budgetary agreements happen over coffee, literally on the back of a\nnapkin. Remember, it’s the effectiveness of your case, not the detail of your analysis, that\nmatters most.\nWhen you see the budget as an ongoing dialogue, and not just a document, you spend more\nof your time and talent on opening channels of communication, educating decision makers and\nhighlighting key priorities and tradeoffs. In short, you focus on ensuring that the effort leads to\nthe right results.\nANSWER THE BIG QUESTIONS. Anticipate and be ready for the big questions. Why are\nwe spending this money? Why does the contact center exist? Why are we spending more (or\nless) than last year? These questions form the backdrop of the budgetary process. The answers\nare sometimes addressed in the communication that takes place during the process, and also may\nbe summarized in budgetary documents. Regardless, those who are involved in preparing and\napproving the budget need a shared understanding of the value the center contributes to the\norganization.\nREMEMBER TO FOCUS ON RESULTS. Handling 1.7 million calls, achieving 90\npercent first-call resolution, or hitting service level targets are not the results decision makers are\nlooking for. They are only means to an end. As your center’s objectives and focus mature from\nhandling interactions efficiently to delivering great customer experiences, you will have a greater\nimpact on business results—including revenues, profitability, market share and word of mouth\n(see figure). Illustrating this connection focuses budgetary discussion on the things that matter\nmost (see Chapters 12 and 13).\nBASE THE BUDGET ON A CLEAR STRATEGY. A necessary first step for a successful\nbudgeting process is agreement on the contact center’s direction and priorities. Your customer\naccess strategy is the framework that defines how customers will interact with your organization\n(see Chapter 2). The customer access strategy is the de facto blueprint for the budget—defining\nwho your customers are; when and how they want to reach you; the means by which you will\nidentify, route, handle and track those contacts; and how you will leverage the information that"

An important principle in managing growth is to do an analysis of its likely impact in\nadvance. The objective is to avoid surprises as you go into the budget process. Accurate growth projections often take the form of a document that illustrates projected costs\nand timeframes, such as 5 percent growth in workload, 10 percent growth, 20 percent growth,\nand so on (up to at least double the current size if you’re growing quickly). Your analysis should\nconsider each major contact center component and answer important questions such as: When\nwill you need additional ACD and IVR capacity? More space? Additional supervisors or\nanalysts? What is the ideal lead time for each increment of growth? How long does it take to\nrecruit, hire and train agents? Contraction is also a planning challenge. Even as many grapple with growth, long-\nestablished contact centers in some industries have closed or reduced in size. For example, hotels\nand airlines have successfully encouraged a large portion of customers to use self-service\nsystems for inquiries, bookings, check-in, and upgrades. In these cases, plans and budgets must\nanticipate how contact centers can be scaled down as workload drops. React too slowly, and\nexpensive and unnecessary resources drive up costs. Cut too quickly, and service will be poor. Because the document is a projection, it won’t precisely predict required resources. But it\nwill illustrate required lead times and key decision points necessary to align resources with\nworkload. Your goal is to help your organization avoid costly surprises. Long-Term Staffing Requirements\nFor most contact centers, staffing makes up between 65 and 75 percent of the budget. These\nfigures can vary greatly depending on salaries, technology investments, cost differences by\nregion, and other factors. But it’s safe to conclude that this one slice of the budgetary pie usually\nexceeds all other costs combined. Getting it right is a make-or-break factor in the center’s\nefficiency and effectiveness. Let’s take a look at the basics of longer-term staff planning. As discussed in Chapter 8,\neffective scheduling depends on both longer-term budgets and short-term execution. You’ll need\na big enough bucket of resources to work with—in other words, the right number of staff on\npayroll (or through contracts) to put together schedules that match workload requirements. You’ll also need to manage schedule adherence, a subject we’ll discuss in Chapter 14. A long-term staffing plan (sometimes called budgetary staffing plan) generally represents\nstaffing requirements at a monthly level for the next 12 months. The goal is to accurately predict\nthe paid hours required to handle the workload at your target service level and response time\nobjectives."

Is the agent scheduled to handle customer contacts?\nRANDOM. Is the agent actually handling a contact?\nLet’s walk through a staffing example that accounts for each of these categories and leads to\nthe number of full-time equivalents (FTEs) required to handle the workload. Here, we’ll look at a\nmonth, which will provide the template for projections you’ll normally be making, which go out\n12 months or more.\nNote that throughout the example, rounding variations can produce slightly different totals\nand results. Also note that we’ll consider the two types of work: service level and response time.\nYou can apply the model to the mix of the channels you handle (e.g., if you need to build\nbudgets for different divisions or agent groups).\nBegin with Workload\nThe workload forecast is the primary driver of staffing needs. Workload includes the\nprojected volume of contacts multiplied by average handling time. The result is then converted\ninto staff hours required. Let’s say your July projections for service level-type contacts are as\nfollows (we’ll factor in response time contacts later):\nJuly Workload: Contact Load\nSo, you have a projected 5,242 hours of workload to handle in July. (If you’re remembering\nfrom Chapter 6 that average handling time often varies increment by increment—you’re right.\nThis estimate is a broad brushstroke used for longer-term staffing calculations and is based on\nthe number you’re most likely to see on average over the month. It’s okay to use it this way for\nlonger-term budgeting purposes—just don’t try to base half-hour-by-half-hour staffing\ncalculations and schedule requirements on an average!)\nIdentify Availability Factors\nNext, you’ll calculate agent availability factors, beginning with presence. The most typical\nvariables that will keep agents from working are vacations, absenteeism, leaves of absence,\ndisability, and holidays.

Because (in our illustration) it is not paid time, it is\nnot included in this model. Also, the factor used for breaks is adjusted for “presence” (you\nshouldn’t count breaks for agents not at work).\nConsequently, if agents are not at work 16.52 percent of the time (meaning they are at work\n83.48 percent of the time), the factor would be 30 minutes (time on breaks) divided by 480\nminutes (minutes in a workday), multiplied by 83.48 percent. Breaks as a percentage of paid time\nis therefore 5.22 percent and not the usual 6.25 percent many managers associate with breaks.\n(Note: Training and coaching percentages are not adjusted by the presence factor, because\nthese activities will be rescheduled when missed due to absence.)\nAvailability: Utilization"

A third category of factors, which can be termed “random,” also\nneeds to be included. Don’t let the term trip you up—schedule adherence, which is in the\nexample below, isn’t random in a mathematical sense like random contact arrival, as you can\ncause a positive impact on schedule adherence (see Chapter 14). But while you can accurately\npredict the total amount of time that will go to these factors, they are random because you cannot\npredict the minute-to-minute impact.

Uh oh, now what?\nEven with good forecasts and accurate schedules, the random arrival of customer contacts\nmeans that contact centers operate in a “demand and supply” mode. Demand must be followed\nby the supply of agents and supporting resources able to handle the workload. If you think about\nit, any given moment, there are almost always either a) more contacts to be handled than\nresources available, or b) more resources than contacts. Those rare times that they are in perfect\nbalance (with no waiting agents and no waiting customers) last a fleeting moment or two, before\nthe balance tips in one direction or the other.\nUp and down, ebb and flow. Contact centers are dynamic, ever-changing environments.\nAnd then—adding to challenge—there are those times that planning goes off the rails. The\nforecast misses the mark. Customers behave differently than expected (e.g., that new app was\nsupposed to reduce workload, not increase it!). Marketing sends a social media blast without\ntelling you. The flu is taking a toll on your team. Oh, and IT is working on a desktop upgrade\nand you are finding that moving … from … screen … to … screen … is … sluggish. Just a little\nmore time, every contact, every agent, all day long.\nSo, even the most accurate contact center planning must be augmented by effective real-time\nmanagement: monitoring events as they happen and making adjustments as necessary. Real-time\nmanagement should complement planning. After the planning is done, it’s the moment-by-\nmoment decisions and actions that enable you to maintain an appropriate service level and\nresponse time.

    "text": "Empowering Your Team\nReal-time management is often viewed as a matter of responding to workload quantities.\nWhat’s often missed in these discussions is how to respond to the nature of the workload. If it’s\nheavy, there usually are underlying issues driving it. You can throw all the resources at it that\nyou want, but if your organization isn’t prepared to handle the content of the work, it’s going to\nbe a struggle—for customers and employees.\nThis is an area where empowerment is so important (we’ll discuss empowerment further in\nChapters 14 and 16). Many organizations want to do the right thing for customers, but too often\nput a multi-layered, time-eroding approval process in place to get there. By then, the customer is\ngone, or the loyalty that could arise from their experience has dwindled. That’s not effective\nempowerment; in fact, it’s not empowerment at all. Your agents must be able to take action as\ncircumstances unfold. You can’t expect them to be effective unless they have the authority and\nmeans to make decisions.\nFor years, The Ritz-Carlton has given staff $2,000 of discretion, per employee and per guest,\nto resolve problems as the employee feels is appropriate. As a senior manager explains,\n“Sometimes the most delightful ‘wow’ moments happen in the blink of an eye. If employees are\nnot empowered and need to cross layers of approval, these moments could be lost forever.” (I\nhave seen this in action—while staying at a Ritz-Carlton, I once had a lunch immediately\ncomped when it was delivered later than promised.)\nMany executives, understandably, are initially concerned with empowering employees to the\nextent that The Ritz-Carlton does. But empowerment is actually cost-effective. Employees\nappreciate the trust and want to make decisions that are right for customers and the organization.\nAnd because it’s happening on the spot, you are saving resources and aggravation by minimizing\nthe need for managers to review and approve decisions.\nThe key is to have clear standards and guidance on how to make good decisions. Here are the\nkinds of questions each employee should be equipped to answer:\n▪ What’s the right thing to do?\n▪ What would resolve the problem for this customer?\n▪ What decision best aligns with our values and mission?\n▪ If absolutely necessary, how and to whom do I escalate this issue?\n▪ How should I best capture information and learnings about this issue so that we are\nequipped as an organization to make improvements going forward?\nTraining and coaching should be focused on these key questions. Create scenarios and role\nplays that strengthen judgment and decision-making skills. You won’t be able to anticipate and\ntrain on every situation that comes along, but you can provide a foundation that leads to good\ndecisions no matter the circumstance."

    "text": "✽✽✽\nHANDLING TOUGH CONTACTS\nHow equipped are your agents for those situations when something is going wrong? When customers are clearly upset? Here\nare some time-tested tips:\n▪ If your organization messed up, acknowledge it in a sincere way—and in plain language. (How often as a customer do you\nsee or hear the scripted words, “We regret any inconvenience this may have caused”?) As writing coach and trainer Leslie\nO’Flahavan soundly advises, if you wouldn’t say something to a customer face-to-face, don’t use it. (I prefer something like,\n“Thanks for letting us know we let you down, and for giving us a chance to make it right.”)\n▪ Some things shouldn’t play out in a public forum, even if that’s where they begin (e.g., through a social media post). Get\nthe customer’s okay to move the discussion elsewhere.\n▪ Take ownership and resolve the issue—if at all possible, fix it! What would it take to earn back the loyalty of this\ncustomer? If the customer is asking for the impossible, at least be prepared to give options.\n▪ How you frame things matters. When speaking with a customer whose flight was hampered by bad weather, there’s a big\ndifference between “I can’t get you on a flight until tomorrow” and “I can get you out first thing in the morning—would you like\nfor me to secure one of those seats?”\n▪ Document what happened and the circumstances that drove it. Problems can (will!) continue to occur until a root cause is\nidentified and resolved.\nHow your agents respond to tough situations, as much as anything else, shows the true character of your organization.\n✽✽✽\nBuilding a Cultural Foundation\nAlong with empowerment, there are principles that, when better understood by your team,\nwill help you build a strong cultural foundation. These include understanding the relationship\nbetween service level and quality, the impact of each person, consistency, and others.\nService Level and Quality\nOne very important principle is the complementary (hand-in-hand) relationship between\nservice level and quality (covered in Chapters 4 and 13). Although service level and quality seem\nto be at odds in the short term, poor quality will force a negative impact on service level in the\nlonger term—by contributing to repeat and escalated contacts, duplicate or parallel contacts, and\nother forms of waste and rework. So, the emphasis should be on handling each contact cleanly\nand correctly, regardless of how backed up the queue is.\nYour agents might believe they are getting mixed signals from management: “Hey, you train\nus to do a quality job, but then you put a lot of emphasis on achieving a service level and\nresponse time objectives. You put queue displays all over the place and get unhappy when\nservice level and response times drop. What do you really want?”"

But remember that each contact must be handled with quality, regardless of what’s\nhappening with service level.\nThe Impact of Each Person\nRemember the law of diminishing returns and the power of one (covered in Chapter 9). The\nmessage, as it relates to real-time management, is clear: When the queue is backed up, each\nperson makes a big difference!\nThis issue sheds light on the importance of training agents on how a queue behaves\n(including how quickly it can spin out of control) and arming them with real-time information so\nthey can adjust priorities as necessary. Real-time information can be delivered via:\n▪ Queue information on desktop displays\n▪ Wall- or ceiling-mounted readerboards\n▪ Displays on phones\n▪ Mobile apps\n▪ Supervisor monitors\n▪ Flip charts (which sounds so last century, but can help bring focus)\nQueue information must be complemented with appropriate training so that agents know\nwhat to look for and how to react. Remember that there are only two things directly within the\ncontrol of agents: being in the right place at the right times, and doing the right things (schedule\nadherence and quality). A backed-up queue does not mean you should modify the process for\nhandling contacts with quality. Real-time queue information must be interpreted in that context, a\nsubject we’ll look at further in this chapter, and in Chapters 12 and 14."

    "text": "It’s important to establish clear expectations around schedule adherence, a subject we’ll\ncover in Chapter 14. Too often, adherence is viewed only as an issue of “how much” (the total\ntime the agent is plugged in) when it’s equally an issue of “when” (are they available at the right\ntimes?). A key responsibility of supervisors and team leaders is to remove schedule roadblocks\nso that agents can be in the right places at the right times. Auto Available and Auto Wrap-Up\nMost ACD systems can be programmed for either “auto available” or “auto wrap-up.” Auto\navailable automatically puts agents into the available mode after they complete a contact. Auto\nwrap-up automatically puts them into the after-call work mode. It usually makes sense to program your system to put agents into the mode they will most\noften need to be in initially. This can save seconds (which add up over the course of a year’s\ncontacts) and minimize the need for agents to manually put themselves into one mode or another. But also give them control over how much time they spend in wrap-up, as the needs of individual\ncontacts dictate. Some managers program their ACD to put agents into the after-call work mode for a\npredetermined amount of time. This is a bad idea, as there is no way you can anticipate how\nmuch time after-call work will take for any individual contact. Averages don’t work here. If your\nobjective is to give agents “breathers” by adding time to after-call work, you are by default\nadding more time to each contact, further backing up the queue (and defeating your purpose). Another alternative you have when programming your ACD is to use a feature generally\nreferred to as “contact forcing” (or “call forcing”). This may strike you as an autocratic-sounding\nterm, but it’s actually a valuable and agent-friendly capability. With this feature, contacts are\nautomatically connected to agents who are available and ready (thereby eliminating the need for\nthem to manually answer contacts). Agents are notified that a contact has arrived by a gentle “zip\ntone” (a beep). Studies indicate that contact forcing can cut four to six seconds from average handling time. And agents almost always like the feature once they get used to it. It removes what would be an\nextra step. Importantly, they remain in full control. If they aren’t ready for a contact, they simply\nstay out of the available mode. ✽✽✽\nPERPETUATING tHE PROBLEM\nReal-time management, though essential, has a serious downside. Real-time tactics that increase supply or curb demand can\nalso undermine the organization’s ability to create accurate resource plans. These approaches—overflowing contacts to secondary\ngroups, postponing breaks and training, or reassigning agents to unplanned work—create skewed activity reports. They can defer\n(delay) essential work or training. And they often complicate future workload and schedule predictions."

    "text": "implications on planning and management.\n✽✽✽\nConsistency\nAnother important step in building a good foundation is to ensure that agents maintain a\nconsistent approach to handling contacts, regardless of queue conditions. Each agent has an\nimpact on the components of workload, and therefore on the data that will be used in forecasting\nand planning for future workloads. When the queue is building, it can be tempting to postpone\nwork that should happen as part of wrap-up. This skews reports, causes planning problems, and\ncan lead to more errors.\nThe solution is to define which types of work should immediately follow contact handling\nand which types can be completed later. Then, train agents and supervisors accordingly.\nAccurate Resource Planning\nReal-time management can never make up for inadequate planning. The nine-step planning\nprocess covered in preceding chapters should be as accurate as possible. This includes:\n▪ Establishing service level and response time objectives that everyone understands\n▪ Accurately forecasting the workload associated with all types of contacts\n▪ Calculating staffing requirements\n▪ Planning for and managing activities not related to handling customer contacts\n▪ Building schedules that match staff to the workload as closely as possible\nMonitoring Real-Time Developments\nThe third major principle in effective real-time management is to monitor developments and\nidentify trends as early as possible. The key is to react appropriately to evolving conditions.\nRandom contact arrival means that, at times, it will look like you are falling behind even though\nyou are staffed appropriately. But if you are experiencing a genuine trend, you need to move\nquickly. Time is of the essence."

    "text": "Interpreting Queue Status\nService level is “rolling” history. The ACD has to look back some amount of time or at some\nnumber of contacts to make the calculation. Consequently, even though service level is a primary\nfocus in planning, it is not a sensitive real-time report. (In the strictest definition, it’s not a real-\ntime report at all.)\nWith many ACDs, you can define how far back the system looks to provide real-time service\nlevel status. You may need to experiment some. You’ll need enough of a sample that reports\naren’t all over the place, but to be valuable, the sample also must be fairly recent. Also note that\n“screen refresh” does not correlate to the timeframe used for calculations. Your monitors may\ndisplay updated information every few seconds, but that has nothing to do with how much data\nyour ACD uses for the calculations that require rolling history.\nService level will tell you what has already happened, given recent unique contact volume,\nrandom arrival, average handling time and staff availability patterns. But it’s important to realize\nthat what is being reported is not necessarily an indication of what is about to happen.\nHowever, the number of contacts presently in queue is a real-time report, as is “longest\ncurrent wait” and “current agent status.” Understanding the distinction between reports that are\ngenuinely real-time and those that must incorporate some history explains apparent\ncontradictions."

    "text": "For example, service level may indicate 65 percent of contacts are answered in 20 seconds,\neven though there are no contacts in queue at the moment. Keep watching the monitor, though,\nand service level will begin to climb. Alternatively, service level may look high at the moment,\neven though an enormous volume of contacts recently entered the queue. Give it a few minutes\nand, unless circumstances change, service level will begin to drop like a rock.\nThere will be a delay of at least several minutes before service level begins to reflect the\nimpact of what is happening. So for service level to have meaning, it must be interpreted in light\nof the recent past, contacts in queue and current longest wait. If you focus on service level alone,\nyou could badly misread the situation.\nUnless conditions change, the number of contacts in queue signals where service level is\nabout to go. So—this piece of data should be a primary focus, along with longest current wait.\nThat information should drive you to assess the mode agents are in—signed off, auxiliary,\nhandling contacts, etc.—and make appropriate adjustments.\nIn summary, focus on real-time reports in this order:\n1. NUMBER OF CONTACTS IN QUEUE. This is the real-time report most sensitive to\nchanges and trends. Look at this first.\n2. LONGEST CURRENT WAIT (OLDEST CONTACT). This is a real-time report, but it\nbehaves like a historical report (e.g., many contacts can enter the queue, but longest current wait\nwill take some time to reflect the problem). This report gives context to the number of contacts in\nqueue. For example, if there are far more contacts in queue than normal, but longest current wait\nis modest, you are at the beginning of a downward trend. Now is the time to react.\n3. SERVICE LEVEL, AVERAGE SPEED OF ANSWER, AVERAGE TIME TO\nABANDONMENT AND OTHER MEASURES OF THE QUEUE AND CUSTOMER\nBEHAVIOR. These reports provide additional context to the number of contacts in queue and\nlongest current wait. For example, if service level is low, but there are few or no contacts in\nqueue, you have addressed the problem and service level will begin to climb. Don’t sweat it.\n4. AGENT STATUS. This real-time report indicates how many agents are available and\nwhat modes they are in. I generally place agent status after other reports because it can be\ndifficult to interpret unless you know something about the queue. For instance—it doesn’t matter\nif few agents are handling contacts if there aren’t many contacts to handle. In that case, you\nwould want agents to be working on other tasks.\nIn the end, you should monitor and interpret these reports together. With the right training on\nwhat real-time information means and the activity it is conveying, experienced agents and\nsupervisors can scan and make sense of the updates quickly.\n✽✽✽\nMonitoring Real-Time Reports"

Escalation plan...\n✽✽✽\nDisplay Thresholds\nMost ACD and wall display systems allow you to establish various priority thresholds. For\nexample, you can color-code information yellow when the queue begins to back up and red when\nit’s in really bad shape.\nThe problem is that the thresholds are often set arbitrarily. Additionally, agents often don’t\nunderstand what is expected of them at different threshold levels. If that’s the case, real-time\ninformation will raise everyone’s stress level. And your agents might feel as if it’s their fault that\nthey can’t clear up the queue.\nTo avoid this, proper programming and training are necessary:\n▪ Generally, the first threshold should be set for one contact in queue. Agents should proceed\nnormally, and no tactical adjustments are required.\n▪ The second threshold should indicate that there are more contacts in queue than the average\nexpected for the desired service level (see “Q2” in Chapter 7). Routine adjustments, such as\npostponing flexible work, should be made to get the contacts answered.\n▪ The next threshold should indicate that there are more contacts in queue than the agents can\nrealistically handle. In this case, more extensive real-time tactics (e.g., bringing in reinforcements\nor triaging the work) are required.\nYou can program many of today’s systems to adjust thresholds dynamically as workloads\nand staffing levels change (10 contacts in queue may be no problem during a fully staffed shift,\nbut would be a nightmare for two agents handling work at 3 a.m.). The most important thing is\nunderstanding where the information comes from and what it takes into account, so that those\ninterpreting it can make good decisions.\nConsidering All Channels\nEver had this happen? Someone looks at the real-time reports and everything is fine, so he or\nshe decides to unplug and begin work on a project or take a break. Unfortunately, others have the\nsame idea at the same time, resulting in queues that quickly spin out of control. Interpreting real-"

The traffic controller’s authority can range from making informed\nsuggestions on priorities to flatly dictating what can and can’t happen at any given time. This\nresponsibility should include the full range of channels.\nThere’s a balance here, though. If you pull agents from response time work (e.g., email,\nsocial media messages that can be deferred) to handle service level (e.g., calls, chat), customers\nwho sent email or social media messages might begin calling.

The\ninformation produced in a contact center in any given week could cover a small parking lot, and\nI’ve seen organizations measure lots of things, yet not make sustained improvements. I am\nconvinced that success is a matter not only of measuring the right things, but also building a\nsupporting culture, removing roadblocks, and ensuring that day-to-day activities support the\norganization’s mission.\nIn this chapter, we’ll look at important definitions, then identify some of the most common\nmetrics in use today. We’ll discuss the objectives and metrics that matter most, and some\ncommon pitfalls to avoid. Lastly, I’ll summarize a process for effective reporting.\nKey Definitions\nThere are terms related to measures and objectives that have important distinctions in\nmeaning.\nMEASURE: A fundamental, quantifiable unit, such as time, length, amount, or size.\nExamples include the time it took to process a claim, and number of customers served.\nMETRIC: Quantifiable values that often comprise more than one measure. For example,\naverage cost of a service interaction incorporates both costs and the number of interactions.\nGOAL: The point of arrival. For example, if a performance objective is to cut turnover in\nhalf, and it is currently 16 percent, the goal is 8 percent turnover.\nPERFORMANCE TARGET: An interim improvement point at a specific point in time; a\n“checkpoint” to reassess progress and correct the action or work plans necessary to reach the\nfinal goal.\nSTANDARD: The requirements, specifications, guidelines, or characteristics established for\ncustomer service.\nPERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE: Usually stated as a quantifiable goal that must be\naccomplished within a given set of constraints, such as a specified period of time or by a given\ndate (e.g., improve customer satisfaction by 10 points within one year)."

    "text": "Metrics in contact centers can be broadly divided into a handful of categories, including:\n▪ Quality\n▪ Accessibility\n▪ Operational efficiency\n▪ Cost performance\n▪ Strategic impact\nLet’s examine common measures within each category. Stick with me here—though this\nchapter doesn’t represent an exhaustive list, we’ll cover quite a few. Getting a snapshot of the\nmany alternatives from which to choose is a good start to selecting metrics and objectives that\nmake sense for your organization.\nBefore we go through the summary, it’s worth noting that many metrics can logically fit into\nmore than one category. Consider agent turnover. Is it a measure of efficiency (newer agents tend\nto be less efficient), cost performance (it is costly to replace agents), or strategic impact (agent\ntenure has an impact on results)? How you categorize measures is not as important as getting\nthem on the table so that you can make sensible choices about which to use and how.\nQuality\nCommon measures related to quality include:\nCONTACT QUALITY. Assigns a value to the quality of individual interactions. Criteria\ngenerally include such things as interpreting customer requirements correctly, entering data\naccurately, providing the correct information, accurate coding, and capturing needed and useful\ninformation. Contact quality is appropriate in all environments as both a high-level indicator of\nthe center’s performance and a specific objective for agents and supervisors. Data typically\ncomes from samples via quality observations or recording contacts and from customer surveys.\nQuality is discussed further in Chapters 13 and 14.\nFIRST-CONTACT RESOLUTION. Studies indicate that organizations incur many\nadditional expenses (some hidden and difficult to track) when customer issues are not fully\nresolved on the first contact. First-contact resolution (FCR) also has a significant impact on\ncustomer satisfaction. Analyzing relative increases and decreases in FCR in response to changes\nin processes, systems and customer requirements can be very informative. Consequently, first-\ncontact resolution is appropriate in all environments as a high-level objective.\nComponents that enable FCR should be built into specific quality objectives for agents—\nhowever, because not all aspects are within their control, they must be selected carefully. FCR\ncan be tracked through quality observation samples, customer surveys (asking customers whether\nthe issues were resolved), contact coding based on agent judgment (supported by clear criteria),\ndata on repeat contacts (e.g., from CRM systems), or a combination. I always recommend that\nFCR be measured both internally and externally."

    "text": "✽✽✽\nPERSPECTIVE ON FIRST-CONTACT RESOLUTION\nFirst-contact resolution has become a popular metric in recent years. And that’s a good thing: Unresolved contacts are a\ncommon source of customer dissatisfaction, and the organization tends to incur many additional expenses (repeat contacts,\nrework, etc.) when issues are not resolved fully.\nHowever, FCR must be implemented carefully. For example:\n▪ An exceptionally high FCR rate may point to many simple contacts that can be prevented before they happen (e.g., through\nbetter products or improved self-service).\n▪ Accurate comparisons with other organizations are difficult because definitions of “resolved contact” vary widely. Focus\non developing an appropriate definition for your environment, and stick to it so that you’ll have a stable, baseline measure.\n▪ Treat FCR as an organization-wide initiative. When an issue is not resolved on the first contact, the problem is often\noutside the contact center (e.g., with product or service documentation, functionality, or processes).\n▪ Track FCR at least two ways—as an internal measure, and based on whether or not customers feel that their issues were\nresolved on the first contact (via survey feedback). If these measures don’t closely correlate, find out why.\nAbove all, keep your eyes on customer experience and business results. Remember that FCR is just a supporting indicator,\nnot the endgame.\n✽✽✽\nERRORS AND REWORK. As with first-contact resolution, there is significant value in\nanalyzing increases and decreases in errors and rework in response to changes in processes,\nsystems, and customer requirements. Measures of errors and rework are appropriate in all\nenvironments, and their specific components are often built into quality objectives for agents\n(variables must be selected carefully because not all errors are within their control). Data may\ncome from quality observation or recording, CRM systems, analytics, contact coding or other\nsources. See Chapter 13.\nAccessibility\nCommon measures related to accessibility include:\nCONTACTS BY CHANNEL. These are simply measures of the number of contacts by\nchannel: phone, chat, social media, self-service, text, email (etc.), and when these contacts occur.\nIf there are customer communities associated with your products and services, it’s a good idea to\nassess that activity and determine how many issues are resolved within the forums versus those\nthat require agent assistance. You should also track the average handle times (AHTs) associated\nwith different kinds of agent-assisted contacts so that you have a complete picture of workload\nby channel.\nThis is essential data for forecasting, and it also is useful as a high-level indication of relative"

SERVICE LEVEL AND RESPONSE TIME. Establishing service level and response time\nobjectives is a necessary step in ensuring that the organization is accessible through whatever\nchannel customers use. Real-time reports are also necessary for tactical adjustments. If multiple\n“exchanges” (back-and-forth communication between agent and customer, common in technical\nsupport) occur, you’ll also need to track overall time to resolution. Service level is available directly from routing systems, social media management tools, and\nworkforce management systems. Response time reports may come from sources such as ACDs\nor related routing systems (e.g., email response management systems), workforce optimization\nsystems, case management tools, social media systems, or, potentially, other sources. (See\nChapters 4 and 7 for detailed discussions on service level and response time.)\nAVERAGE SPEED OF ANSWER (ASA). ASA is often misinterpreted as a “typical”\nexperience, but the average is skewed by many customers who get answered before the ASA and\nsome who wait far longer than the ASA (see discussion on this topic in Chapter 4). ASA has\nimportant operational applications; for example, it is a component of trunk load (Chapter 7). Data on ASA is available from the same systems that provide information on service level. ABANDONED AND BLOCKED CONTACTS. Abandoned contacts and those that are\nblocked through busy signals or busy messages are generally caused by insufficient staffing or\ninsufficient system resources. They should be considered supporting information to service level\nand response time reports, not primary objectives (see Chapter 4). Data on abandoned contacts is\navailable directly from ACD or workforce management reports or from servers handling specific\ntypes of contacts, such as chat. Reports on busy signals may come from the ACD (if using ACD-\ncontrolled busies), the local telephone company or the interexchange (long-distance) company. See Chapter 6. LONGEST DELAY. Also referred to as oldest contact, this figure gives you the longest\namount of time a customer had to wait before reaching an agent or abandoning. It is appropriate\nin all environments as supporting information to service level and response time objectives, and\nit is available from the same sources that provide service level data. Operational Efficiency\nCommon measures related to efficiency include:\nFORECAST ACCURACY. Forecasting the workload accurately is a high-leverage activity\nand is fundamental to managing a contact center effectively. Forecasted versus actual workload\nis appropriate in all environments as a high-level objective, and (as discussed in Chapter 6)\nshould be reported down to the interval level. It is also used for ongoing tactical adjustments."

The likelihood or number of times customers contact the\norganization, typically on an annual basis. Propensity to contact is usually represented as a\nnumerical correlation between total contacts and total customers. For example, 4 would mean\nthat customers contact the organization an average of four times per year. Propensity to contact is fashioned after a similar principle that has been used for many years\nin economics and marketing: propensity to buy. It is appropriate in any contact center, and it can\nbe helpful in forecasting, gauging relative progress in first-contact resolution, contact avoidance\n(through simpler or more reliable products and services) or assessing marketing effectiveness. Data comes from the CRM system or sources that track total customers and total contacts. SCHEDULED STAFF VERSUS ACTUAL. This metric compares the number of agents\nscheduled with the number actually working the schedule. It is appropriate in all environments as\na high-level objective for the center and for teams. As with forecasts, reports should show each\ninterval. The purpose of the objective is to understand and improve staff adherence and\nschedules. Scheduled staff is available from the system used for scheduling (e.g., the workforce\noptimization system). Actual staff available is reported primarily by the ACD, related routing\nand management systems, or the workforce optimization system. See Chapters 8 and 14. ADHERENCE TO SCHEDULE. Measures of how much time (and when) during agents’\nshifts that they are taking or available to take contacts. Adherence to schedule is appropriate in\nall environments as a high-level objective, and it also is a common and recommended objective\nfor individuals and teams. The measures are independent of whether the center actually has the\nstaff necessary to achieve a targeted service level and/or response time; they simply gauge how\nclosely agents adhere to schedules. Data generally comes from ACD and workforce management\nreports. For a detailed discussion, see Chapter 14. AVERAGE HANDLING TIME (AHT). AHT is appropriate in all environments for\nforecasting, planning, and process improvement activities. However, it is generally not\nrecommended as an agent standard. In many centers, AHT has been increasing as agent-assisted\ncontacts have become more complex, due to the fact that advanced self-service capabilities have\noffloaded the simpler contacts. Cross-sell and upsell initiatives can also add time to contacts. Relative reductions in AHT through better processes, technologies and training can create\nsignificant efficiencies. AHT is available from ACD or related routing systems, as well as\nworkforce management reports. See Chapters 6 and 13. OCCUPANCY AND CONTACTS HANDLED.

Cost Performance\nCommon measures related to cost performance include:\nCOST PER CONTACT. Cost per contact (CPC) is appropriate in all environments as a\nhigh-level metric (generally reported monthly or quarterly). However, it must be interpreted\ncorrectly. An increase in CPC can, in some cases, be a good sign (e.g., process improvements\nmay result in fewer contacts, spreading fixed costs over fewer contacts and driving up cost per\ncontact). Volume of contacts comes from ACD reports, and potentially other systems that track\ncontacts. Cost data comes from several sources, including payroll (for staffing costs), budgets\n(for equipment, building depreciation, etc.), and telecommunications reports (for network costs). AVERAGE CONTACT VALUE. Average contact value is appropriate for revenue-\ngenerating environments, such as reservation centers and retailers, where contacts have a\nmeasurable value. It is typically reported quarterly or monthly, but sometimes more frequently. Many organizations incorporate and track cross-sell and upsell results. Average contact value is\nchallenging to apply (and generally not recommended) in centers where the value of contact is\ndifficult to measure (e.g., customer service centers and technical support). Revenue information\ncomes from any report that includes revenue generated by the contact center—sales reports, total\norders, CRM system reports, etc. Volume of contacts requires reports from the ACD or related\nrouting systems, along with the workforce optimization system. REVENUE. As with average contact value, measures of revenue are appropriate for\nrevenue-generating environments and can be reported quarterly, monthly, daily, or for other\nspecific time periods. Results are often correlated with other variables, such as contact center\ncosts, market conditions and revenues through other channels within the organization (e.g., retail\nor the direct sales force) to gauge the contact center’s impact on the organization’s profits. Revenue information comes from any report that includes revenue generated by the contact\ncenter, such as sales reports, CRM system reports, etc. BUDGETED TO ACTUAL EXPENDITURES. Often called variance reports, these\nmeasures illustrate the differences between projected and actual expenditures for various budget\ncategories (see example in Chapter 10). They are appropriate in all environments as high-level\nmetrics, assuming they are considered within the context of changing workload variables and\ncontact center responsibilities. They are generally produced both quarterly and annually, and\nthey may be available monthly (or more often in some environments). Budget versus actual\ninformation can be formulated from corporate accounting systems, workforce optimization\nsystems, or customized applications. OBJECTIVES FOR OUTBOUND."

    "text": "are appropriate and necessary in environments that include outbound contacts.\nStrategic Impact\nCommon measures related to strategic impact include:\nEMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT. Studies have demonstrated that customer satisfaction and\nloyalty increase as agent engagement increases. Results of surveys to gauge agent engagement\nshould be compared with employee engagement in other parts of the organization. Data is\ngenerally captured via anonymous surveys, and it can be augmented by focus groups and one-on-\none interviews. See Chapters 14 and 16.\nTURNOVER. Retention is an increasingly important metric as contact centers become more\ncomplex and agent skills and experience requirements escalate. Reductions in turnover typically\ncan be translated into financial savings, overall improvements in quality and productivity, and\nhigher levels of strategic contribution.\nTurnover reports are often produced monthly (calculated on an annualized basis) and should\nbe categorized as voluntary (they decide to leave), involuntary (they are forced to leave), or\ninternal (which is often positive, as it could mean a promotion or strategic move to another area).\nI also suggest you look at when it occurs—see Chapter 14. Data is captured and reports\ngenerated from human resources information systems (HRIS) and/or workforce management\nsystems.\nCUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND LOYALTY. Measuring customer satisfaction or\nrelated perceptions of service is necessary and appropriate in all environments and has the\ngreatest value when trended over time and correlated with other measures and developments\n(e.g., what impact do changes in policies, services and processes have on customer satisfaction?).\nData can come from surveys, focus groups, product and service reviews, social media posts, and\nother sources. Customer loyalty is usually viewed through measures of repeat business over time\n(improved “wallet share”), cross-sells and upsells. See this chapter for discussions of customer\nsatisfaction, customer effort score, and net promoter score. Also see Chapters 2 and 13.\nSENTIMENT TRENDING. Sentiment analysis focuses on the nature of customer\ncomments about a company’s products, services, and reputation. It is an important aspect of\nsocial media customer service; with speech and text analytics tools it can be applied to\ninteractions captured through virtually any channel. Sentiment can be broadly categorized as\npositive, negative, or neutral. Deeper levels of analysis can correlate findings with changes in\nservices and products, competitive trends, customer demographics and other variables.\nSTRATEGIC VALUE. Measures and objectives related to strategic value seek to identify,\nquantify, track, improve and communicate the contact center’s return on investment (ROI) and\nimpact on other business units.

Literally hundreds of other metrics—or combinations thereof—\nexist. Let your needs, objectives, and imagination lead to other possibilities for consideration.\n7 Essential Areas of Focus\nGiven the sheer number of possibilities, and the constant change in the business environment,\nmany managers are looking for guidance on objectives and standards. Where do we stand? What\nare others doing? What performance is good enough? What will please customers? What is\n“world-class”?\nThese are reasonable questions, and you should be asking them. But let’s start with a basic\ntruth: ultimately, you will need to establish metrics and objectives that are right for your\norganization. That involves learning all you can about the process of establishing contact center\nobjectives and how variables are interrelated, developing a solid customer access strategy, and\ntying it to your organization’s overall strategic objectives, and then establishing the metrics and\nobjectives that make sense for you.\n“The test of any policy in management…is not whether the answer is right or wrong, but\nwhether it works.\"\nPETER F. DRUCKER\n“Okay,” you might be saying. “I agree with the notion of choosing objectives that are right\nfor our organization. Still … help me get started. Which measures absolutely, positively must be\nin place?”\nFair enough. There are seven categories of measures that every contact center should have\n(we’ll discuss areas of focus for individual agents in Chapter 14). I recommend you view them as\nbuilding blocks, from most tactical to most strategic. And I’ll discuss them in that order, from the\nbottom up."

    "text": "FORECAST ACCURACY. If you don’t have an accurate prediction of the workload\ncoming your way, it’s almost impossible to deliver efficient, consistent service and achieve high\nlevels of customer satisfaction. That’s true for any channel—phone, chat, social media, and\nothers. SCHEDULE FIT AND ADHERENCE. If you have a good handle on the workload, you\ncan build accurate schedules that ensure the right people are in the right places at the right times. This is best managed from the bottom up, with ample buy-in from agents, and it is an important\nenabler to everything else you’re trying to accomplish. SERVICE LEVEL AND RESPONSE TIME. These objectives are really just outcomes—\nthe result of forecasting the workload and matching it with the right resources. If customer\ncontacts don’t get to the right places at the right times, little else good can happen. Establishing\nservice level and response time objectives is key to ensuring that the organization is accessible\nwherever and whenever customers choose to interact. QUALITY AND FIRST-CONTACT RESOLUTION. Quality is the link between contact-\nby-contact activities and the organization’s most important objectives. First-contact resolution is\nessentially an extension of quality—a tangible result of getting quality right. Quality measures\nshould be applied to every type of customer interaction. EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT. Employee engagement strongly impacts customer\nexperience, and it is an essential measure in any environment. Agent engagement often has a\ndefinable, positive correlation with retention, productivity, and quality. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND LOYALTY. Customer satisfaction is essential in all\nenvironments. It has the greatest value as a relative measure and in conjunction with other\nmetrics (e.g., what impact do changes in policies, services and processes have on customer\nsatisfaction?). Customer loyalty is usually viewed through the totality of the customer’s\nrelationship with the business. Robust methodologies such as net promoter score or customer\neffort score can provide deeper insight into improvement opportunities, and a baseline for\nbenchmarking (see Should You Have an Overall KPI, below). STRATEGIC VALUE. What contributions does the contact center make to product\ninnovations, revenue, marketing initiatives, and other business objectives? Strategic measures are\noften focused on examples of impact in these and related areas, fueled by listening, engaging,\nand learning from customer interactions. See Chapters 10 and 13. Other metrics and objectives should be driven by your organization’s mission and objectives. For example, many customer service environments focus on customer satisfaction, efficiency\nissues and cost measures. Sales environments often base key objectives on revenue, cross-sell,\nupsell and customer retention activities."

I agree 100%, and that is a theme throughout this book. The best contact centers are\npassionately focused on customer experience. They enable their organizations’ personalities to shine through. And you can see it\nin customer loyalty, agent engagement, and great business results.\n✽✽✽\nShould You Have an Overall KPI?\nMany successful leaders establish an overall metric that reflects customer experience. I think\nthat’s a wise move, but it’s important to do so with a caution in mind.\nThere are several common methods you can choose from when establishing an overall KPI,\nincluding customer satisfaction, net promoter score (NPS) and customer effort score (CES). The\nidea is to have an easy way for anyone to see how things are going. To liken it to sports, the\nactions your team takes represent what’s happening on the field. The metric provides the score.\nCUSTOMER SATISFACTION. Surveys that measure customer satisfaction, or “CSAT” as\nit’s sometimes called, are one common approach. They are based on variations of the question\n“How satisfied are you?” or “How would you rate your experience?”\nCSAT is not a measure of customer loyalty, which is what we’d really love to know (but only\nbehavior can truly gauge loyalty). And it’s tough to use CSAT for benchmarking because\nspecific approaches vary widely. But it’s so common that you may already have years’ worth of\ndata within your organization that can serve as a baseline.\nNET PROMOTER SCORE. Net promoter score (NPS) is another popular approach, and\nit’s based on the survey question “How likely is it that you will recommend us to others?” Input\nis provided on a ten-point scale, with 10 being very likely to recommend. In calculating the\nscore, 9s and 10s are considered to be promoters, 7s and 8s are neutral and 6s and below are\ndetractors.\nThe overall net promoter score is then expressed as an absolute number between -100 and\n+100, which is the difference between the percentage of promoters and detractors. So if you have"

    "text": "75% promoters and 20% detractors, the NPS will be 55. Net promoter scores above 0 are\nconsidered good; I love to see scores above 50, which are excellent. USAA, Patagonia, Fidelity\nInvestments, and Apple had scores well above 50 in a recent report. Some critics question whether NPS can identify specific improvement opportunities. But it’s\nused by over two thirds of Fortune 500 companies, so it can be a good basis for comparison. CUSTOMER EFFORT SCORE. Customer effort score (CES) is emerging as an alternative\nto customer satisfaction and net promoter score. It’s based on the question “How easy was it to\nresolve your issue?” Responses are captured on a seven-point scale—7 being very easy. Research by the Corporate Executive Board (CEB) shows customer effort to be a strong\npredictor of customer loyalty. It’s also appropriate for service in organizations that have no\ncompetition, such as a government agency. Let me offer a couple of cautions when using any of these alternatives. First, measures of\ncustomer experience don’t have much value unless you know what’s driving them. So, they are\nbest viewed along with other metrics. Verbatim comments also can be very helpful (and with\nlarge sets of data, analytics applications can be a great help in identifying themes and pain\npoints). Second, ensure that overall scores are not the only thing you—or senior executives—look at. Be sure to also follow customer behavior. Do they continue to buy? Do they try new products? What are they saying about you in social media channels? The right leadership approach is so important. Remember, you’re not trying to produce\nscores; you want results. You want a real understanding of the impact and value of the contact\ncenter, and these survey scores are just part of the picture. (See Navy Federal Credit Union\nLeaves Scores Behind, Chapter 14). ✽✽✽\nFROM METRICS TO VALUES AT HERSHEY\nThere was a time we emphasized a lot of metrics at Hershey Entertainment & Resorts (where I served at that time as\nManager, Training & Guest Experience). But we also were aware that a key element of employee engagement is making a\nconnection between work and each employee’s intrinsic values. So we came to the conclusion that we should put more focus on\nliving out our values—we believed good results (including in our metrics) would follow. These efforts led to a program called “Legacy Checks.” Our intent was for our employees to live, breathe, and genuinely\nbelieve in our four core values—Own, Anticipate, Delight and Inspire. Rather than just posting values on a wall, we defined what\nit looked like to embody each value—with co-workers, customers, and in everyday work. We implemented an on-the-spot\nrecognition program to reward people for demonstrating our values in their day-to-day work. This included a hand-written note,\nwas tied to a monetary reward, and explicitly outlined the positive behavior and associated core value."

Our employees authentically served customers with the company’s values as their guiding light, our leaders\nmade decisions based on true business priorities, and we delivered exceptional experiences for our customers. We could see the\npositive results in both customer loyalty and employee engagement. And yes, in our metrics as well. In short, we focused on\nvalues rather than metrics. That made all the difference."

    "text": "By Justin Robbins, JM Robbins & Associates\n✽✽✽\nAvoiding Common Pitfalls\nIn the 1960s, as mainframe computers were entering the business world—and inspiring much\nawe—sociologist William Bruce Cameron observed that it would be nice if everything could be\nrepresented in numbers and “run through an IBM machine.” But he warned, “not everything that\ncan be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.”\nIt’s a quotation sometimes attributed to Albert Einstein, and though the source may not be\nclear, the message certainly is. And it’s fair warning. You have to be mindful about the metrics\nyou establish, how much you read into them, and how you use them to guide decisions.\nHere are some common “metric pitfalls” to avoid:\nHAVING BLIND SPOTS. I recall meeting with executives of a large firm that provides HR\nand payroll services. They had won awards for the quality of their contact center service. But\nthey were seeing some troubling downward trends in customer satisfaction. Why? What was\nwrong?\nAs we discussed the full range of service channels (e.g., social media, mobile apps, and\nothers), I pulled up their Facebook site on a laptop projecting to a screen at the front of the room\n—and heard a collective gasp. Alongside well-intentioned and upbeat messages from the\ncompany was a string of posts from a frustrated customer who needed help with a simple\npassword reset, but had received no response. His posts were in all-capital letters; it was clear he\nwas upset. The company didn’t have a service presence (let alone metrics!) in some of the\nchannels their customers expected. It was time to broaden the reach of what they were\nmeasuring.\nESTABLISHING TOO MANY METRICS. Another pitfall is having far too many metrics,\nalong with the message that they somehow must all be tracked and managed. There is a tendency\nfor that to happen: someone sees an improvement opportunity or operational gap, believes that a\nreport could provide visibility, and adds it to the mix.\nHowever, there’s often a lack of similar efforts to cut down and eliminate reports that aren’t\nhelpful. Or to differentiate between supporting metrics and those that are most important. Clutter\nhas a significant downside. If there are too many metrics, your team’s focus will be diluted.\nPAINTING AN OVERLY OPTIMISTIC PICTURE. Reporting the contact center in the\nbest possible light can undermine success. There are a lot of ways to produce reports so that the\ncenter looks as effective as possible to senior management. However, if you mask serious\nresource deficiencies or problems with processes, the center is less likely to get the resources and\nsupport it needs. That, in turn, will undermine your ability to perform (see Chapter 4)."

When upper-level managers see room for\nimprovement, they tend to feel more assured they are getting the whole story (plus, being\ntransparent and presenting the whole picture is the right thing to do).\nCREATING CONFLICTING MESSAGES. I too often see service metrics that conflict\nwith each other, leaving the team to guess what’s most important. For example, an insurance\ncompany recently began focusing on first-contact resolution. This is a wise move, and customers\nappreciate it; it contributes to true effectiveness. But their cost per interaction began going up,\nlargely for a reason that is not immediately obvious: they have proportionally fewer interactions,\nbecause they are preventing repeat and unnecessary work. So fixed costs are being allocated\nacross fewer contacts. Their total costs are going down, and they’ve had to re-educate managers\nto not look at average cost per contact in a vacuum.

And it defeats much of the value in what you can learn about the customer’s\nexperience.\nTRYING TO MATCH “BENCHMARKS.” As you work toward achieving important\nobjectives, it’s essential that your team recognizes what the metrics are really saying. Don’t get\ntrapped by benchmarks. For example:\n▪ Maybe your first-contact resolution rate is lower than what similar organizations say they\nare achieving; but you might be measuring it more rigorously and/or working to handle easy\ncontacts without the assistance of agents.\n▪ Your center’s average handling time (AHT) might be higher than that of other centers.\nHowever, if you’re using that time to prevent repeat contacts, refine processes and capture\ninformation that can improve products and marketing, your efficiency (and associated costs) may\nbe far better than they are for those other centers.\n▪ Your service level or response time objectives may be more modest than others in your\nindustry.

Not if you are aware of these\npitfalls, and do the work necessary to leverage the potential of your metrics to drive innovation\nand improvement.

I concur with these estimates—there’s a lot of opportunity in many contact centers.\nReporting Contact Center Activity\nReporting contact center activity to senior-level management and others in the organization\ncan seem like a daunting task. Contributing to the challenge is the wide variety of activities in a\ntypical center, the reality of senior management not having the time to pore over detailed reports,\nand the fact that summary reports often gloss over important information. Consequently, many\ndiligently prepared reports either go unread or are misunderstood.\nClearly, good communication doesn’t happen just because detailed information is available.\nAny manager buried in reports yet struggling to convey basic realities can attest to this. As with\nbudgets, the process you establish to communicate ongoing contact center activity is as important\nas the information itself.\nThe following steps can help you identify and prepare meaningful reports and ensure that\nthey are understood:\n1. DETERMINE YOUR OBJECTIVES. What are the objectives for the reports? In other\nwords, what should other managers know about the contact center or the information it has\nacquired, and why? To find the answers, assemble a team of managers from across the\norganization for a working discussion. (And don’t forget to include other members of the contact\ncenter team, such as supervisors, team leads, and agents.) General areas of interest usually\ninclude:\n▪ Customer experience and voice of the customer\n▪ Quality measurements\n▪ Access alternatives and workload trends\n▪ Contributions to other business units\n▪ Costs and revenues\n▪ Queue reports (such as service level and abandonment)\n▪ Resource utilization and requirements (e.g., staffing and scheduling needs)\nFrom these major categories, important measurements will emerge. It’s often useful to\npreface this exercise with a question like, “In an ideal world, what would we really want to know"

Your objectives—not the reports you happen to\nhave—should drive this process.\n2. IDENTIFY SUPPORTING INFORMATION. List the possible reporting alternatives\nunder each of the objectives you identified in the first step. Include information from systems,\ndatabases, surveys, other departments, and external sources.\nThe challenge now becomes one of selection. Stephanie Winston, author of the classic book\nThe Organized Executive, advises that a report should not simply collect facts, but serve as a\njudgment tool for management. To pare down the lists, Winston suggests asking a variety of\nquestions: Is the report really necessary? What questions does it answer? Which reports would\nyou dispense with if you had to pay for them? Could several reports be combined? Will you act\non the information to effect change?\n3. PUT THE INFORMATION IN A USER-FRIENDLY FORMAT. Once you have a list\nof desired reports, the next step is to compile them into a simple, understandable format. This\noften means creating illustrations. For example, simple line charts can illustrate trends that would\notherwise appear as hard-to-decipher numbers. Reports that rely on graphs may take more pages,\nbut a five-page report consisting primarily of graphs is often quicker to read and easier to\ncomprehend than two pages of detailed numbers in rows and columns. Look for data that can be\ncombined or contrasted to provide a more complete story (see example).\n4. CLARIFY INFORMATION THAT COULD BE MISLEADING. As any seasoned\ncontact center manager has learned, you can make reports show just about whatever you want.\nFor example, you can prop up service level by overflowing contacts to other groups, changing\ndistribution priorities, or taking messages for later callbacks. Or you can provide overall reports\nfor longer timeframes that conceal problematic intervals. Clearly, simply providing high-level\nreports on service level or quality can be misleading. The reader needs more information."

EDWARDS DEMING\nT\nhe ongoing need to improve quality and performance has led to numerous management\nmovements over the years. By the mid-20th century, the world had seen the rise of scientific\nmanagement (Frederick Taylor), human relations, inspection, safety, statistical quality control,\nand others. More recent examples include Six Sigma, management by objectives (MBO), total\nquality management (TQM), reengineering, Kaizen, and Lean Six Sigma.\nSo, today’s generation of quality, performance, and customer experience initiatives is\nbuilding on a rich history. Naturally, new ideas and methods will follow. But some core themes\nhave emerged from these management advances—principles that are today guiding\ndevelopments in contact centers.\nMy purpose here is to make sense of these principles and to (hopefully!) inspire you to see\nthe vast opportunity that exists to innovate and improve. As you drive the right kind of change,\neverybody wins—your customers, your employees, and your organization.\n1. Quality Must Be Based on Customer Needs and Expectations\nThe need to identify and address customer expectations stems from a widely accepted\nprinciple: improvements in customer satisfaction lead to increased customer loyalty, better\nbusiness results and a stronger brand reputation. That’s why the customer access strategy must\nbe based on the ten customer expectations (see Chapter 2). Consider the old adage about building\nthe best-quality horse buggy in town: it doesn’t matter if no one wants it.\n✽✽✽\nTEN KEY CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS\n(no specific order)\n1. Be accessible\n2.

Be socially responsible and ethical\n✽✽✽\nA lesser-known but similarly powerful principle is also at work: meeting customer\nexpectations often translates into higher levels of service that are delivered at proportionally\nlower costs. Yes, more loyal customers save the organization lots of marketing dollars. But\nthere’s more to it than that.\nTake the simple issue of being courteous (one of the ten primary customer expectations). In\ntoday’s environment, that means such things as: don’t make customers repeat the same\ninformation, don’t transfer them around, and don’t make them go over their account history\nagain. Customers don’t know (nor should they care) that these guidelines require processes and\nsystems that deliver relevant information to the right agent at the right time. To them, it’s simply\na matter of courteous service."

Being responsive, handling contacts right the first time,\nrelaying expectations to customers—everybody wins, including customers, employees, and\nshareholders.\nThree key questions that should always be part of your decision-making process are: What\nare your customers’ expectations? Are you meeting or exceeding them? Are you using the fewest\npossible resources to do so?\nDon’t guess at what your direction should be. Listen to what customers are saying in surveys,\nsocial media posts, feedback sites—doing everything you can to put yourself in their shoes.\nAbove all, take every opportunity to listen to, engage with and learn from customers during\ninteractions.\n✽✽✽\nSEEING THINGS AS YOUR CUSTOMERS DO\nMany successful leaders are uneasy with depending on surveys and aggregated data to tell them what’s really happening\nwith customers. They want to put themselves in their customers’ shoes. They want to see their organization, products, employees\nand competitors as their customers do.\nThe late Herb Kelleher, founder of Southwest Airlines, made spending time with customers and employees both a regular\npractice and a priority. He’d fly different routes, wander through airports, and strike up conversations. Howard Schultz, former\nchairman and CEO of Starbucks, spent significant time in stores, which helped him see opportunities (such as investing in shorter\nespresso machines so baristas can have eye contact with customers).\nMany leaders find that spending time with customers feels awkward at first. But for the most effective among them, this\ncommitment becomes the norm; it becomes an indispensable part of their perspective and decisions.\n✽✽✽\n2. Quality and Service Level Work Together\nQuality and service level are inextricably associated with, and complementary to, each other.\nAs discussed in Chapter 4, service level is an enabler. As service level deteriorates, more\ncustomers will verbalize their criticisms when they finally do reach an agent. Agents spend\nvaluable time apologizing. Handling times go up. Burnout increases. Morale and turnover take a\nhit, leading to an increase in recruitment and training costs.\nWhen you consider the components of a quality contact, the complementary relationship\nbetween quality and service level becomes evident. Think through how each applies in your\nenvironment. What if data is not entered correctly? What if the customer doesn’t have confidence\nthe contact was handled correctly? What if you didn’t capture useful information from the\ninteraction?"

(If you haven’t had the opportunity, I encourage you to experience it: go handle\nsome contacts that begin, “I hate your system” or “Everyone must be on break, huh?”)\nUnder this kind of pressure, any of us are bound to make more mistakes.

The late Peter Drucker often used\nan orchestra analogy to remind us that a manager has the task of creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. “A\nconductor must always hear both the orchestra and the second oboe,” he said. “Can you hear the second oboe?”\nThere’s a fine line here: We need to understand how specific activities influence overall results, but we are being\nirresponsible if we cut oboes or add trumpets simply because this or that study shows they have X and Y impact on customer\nsatisfaction. As any coach, conductor, or artist knows, there’s more to it than that.\n✽✽✽\nSmall Improvements Lead to Big Returns\nWith any of these tools and methods, there is a danger of getting caught up in the analysis\nprocess itself and forgetting to move on to problem resolution. Once you’ve identified problems\nto tackle, assign responsibilities, provide necessary resources, and make the improvements. Then\ntrack progress."

A government agency\nlearned from frontline agents that constituents (customers) were sharing information in a\ndifferent way than the system was capturing data. The customer service team worked with IT to\nredesign the screens and data fields used during interactions. This cut the average time to handle\ninteractions by 3% (which, with an average cost per contact of $9, was 27 cents per contact).\nHere’s the impact: with 620,000 annual contacts, the value of this improvement was $167,400\nevery year (3% × $9 × 620,000). The savings exceeded $1 million within six years. 27 cents!\nYes, even small changes can really add up.\n5. Contact Centers Enable Significant Strategic Value\nAs outlined in the first chapter, customer contact centers have the potential to create value on\nthree distinct levels: efficiency, customer satisfaction and business unit (strategic) value. Level\nthree—working with other business units—is where you can truly begin to leverage the contact\ncenter’s potential to deliver strategic value to the organization.\nAs a primary customer touchpoint, the contact center has enormous potential to provide other\nbusiness units with valuable intelligence and support. This can include input on customers,\nproducts, services, and processes. When this information is captured, identified, assimilated, and\nturned into usable knowledge, it can literally transform an organization’s ability to identify and\nmeet customer expectations.\nThe following list (which I encourage you to use and add to) summarizes the key benefits\nand support the contact center can provide to other business units.\nSales and Marketing\n______ Deepens customer relationships\n______ Helps recognize and reward loyal customers\n______ Helps identify effective campaign strategies\n______ Supports segmentation, branding, and personalization\n______ Captures customer insight on competitors\n______ Frees sales reps and others to be more productive\n______ Other:\nManufacturing/Operations\n_____ Pinpoints quality and production problems\n_____ Provides input on the usability and clarity of products and services\n_____ Contributes to product documentation and procedures\n_____ Highlights distribution problems and opportunities\n_____ Facilitates communication related to capacity or production problems\n_____ Other:\nResearch and Development (R&D)/Design\n_____ Provides information on competitive direction and trends"

Products include control systems for lighting, ceiling fans, shading and others, which can be controlled from smartphones, voice\nassistants (such as Alexa), and other devices. At a recent ICMI conference, Matt Dixon, advisor and coauthor of The Effortless Experience, and Tim Donchez, Continuous\nImprovement Director at Lutron Electronics, presented a case study of Lutron’s experience in harnessing strategic value. Lutron’s\ncontact centers handle complex interactions—they come from retail partners, distributors, electricians, architects, individual\nconsumers and others. And they inherently involve products not only from Lutron, but from other companies as well. Tim shared\nan essential ingredient to success: “We hire great people, and we trust them to use their judgment to serve our customers.”\nLutron records calls and uses analytics to better understand the content of those calls, but not with improving frontline\nperformance as the objective. Instead, the goal is to mine the rich feedback customers provide on Lutron’s products, brand,\nservices, installation experiences and (as Matt puts it), “almost every other thing that leaders at Lutron need to make better\nproducts and deliver a better experience to their customers.”\nTim points to numerous insights that have been gleaned through this approach. For example, a particularly vexing\ninstallation problem that drove a lot of calls was solved by addressing some confusing language in the installation instructions. In\nother examples, the contact center partnered with the engineering team on new product launches, and provided guidance to retail\npartners on products and services."

A number of key\nlessons have emerged:\n▪ Seek first to understand. Develop good working relationships with the individuals who run\nother areas of the organization. Learn about their goals and objectives and how the contact center\nmight best support their needs.\n▪ Build an understanding of the contact center’s role and potential. Ensure that the prevailing\nperspective is that the role of the center is to serve other parts of the organization, not to point out\nflaws.\n▪ Build a team that is focused on capturing, analyzing, sharing, and using value-added\ninformation across the organization. A suggested ratio is that you need one business analyst for\nevery 30 to 50 agents. The ideal ratio depends on many factors, but will become clearer once you\nget started.\n▪ Ensure that quality at the point of customer contact is given the broadest possible definition\n(e.g., that coaching, quality observation and objectives at the agent level are all considered\nessential elements of these major strategic opportunities).\n▪ Define assumptions and unknowns in reports and data. Ensure that everyone understands\nwhere the data comes from and what definitions are in place. Strategic decisions based on\nmisinterpreted reports can be worse than if there were no reports at all.\n▪ Get the best tools you can. Analytics and performance management systems can help you\nanalyze content, detect trends and causal factors, and identify improvement opportunities. Get\nstarted even if you don’t have these capabilities, but work toward acquiring and building\nsupporting technologies.\n▪ Don’t get overwhelmed. There is a ton of information that you could provide to each\nbusiness unit. Instead of focusing on quantity (by trying to ensure that everything that may be\nvaluable is shared), concentrate on providing the information that is likely to be most useful.\nEvery interaction your center handles provides insight into processes, products, policies,\nservices, customers, and the external environment. You have the opportunity to play a central\nrole in building a stronger organization with better services and products across the board. But\nit’s a role that must be earned.\n6.

But, as many leaders have learned (some the hard way), off-the-shelf prescriptions\nand simplistic formulas tend to fail.\nFortunately, there are principles that don’t change and that you can trust. For example, be\nconsistent and relentlessly focused on the values that matter. Lead by example. Set the right\nperformance expectations. Encourage involvement and work hard to establish good channels of\ncommunication. Give people the chance to learn and grow. Expect the best.\nWe’ll look at these and other related principles in this chapter. And we’ll explore key\nperformance objectives, quality observation, calibration, coaching, and training practices.\nFinally, we’ll look at how to measure and positively manage turnover.\nEstablishing an Engaging Environment\nWhen my daughter Grace was 13 years old, she bought a new camera. She had saved for\nmany months and was very excited. But in the weeks that followed, many pictures turned out\nblurry and I could see her interest fade. We later learned that the camera was faulty and, when\nmade aware, the store immediately replaced it.\nThen the real magic happened. An employee, Devon, stayed 30 minutes past her shift to help\nGrace set up and test the new camera. “You’ll LOVE it!” she reassured her. “I have the same\nmodel!” This employee was clearly engaged and passionate about her job. And that enthusiasm\nwill likely have a lifelong impact on my daughter’s interest in photography.\nEmployee engagement is a term we all hear and use, but what is it exactly? We know it’s not\nthe same as employee satisfaction. An employee can be satisfied with their job for various\nreasons—geographical convenience, friendships, compensation—without really being engaged.\nOne good definition of engagement is “the enthusiasm or emotional commitment an employee\nhas to the organization and the work they do.”\nThe impact of employee engagement is incredible.

Other studies show that quality improves,\ncustomer loyalty goes up, and employee turnover goes down.\nThe National Business Research Institute (NBRI) identified six traits of engaged employees.\nThey make a great starting place when thinking about your team. Engaged employees:\n▪ Believe in their organization\n▪ Have the desire to work to make things better\n▪ Understand the business context and big picture\n▪ Are respectful and helpful to colleagues\n▪ Are willing to go the extra mile\n▪ Stay up to date with developments in their industry\nI recommend having a candid discussion with your team, using these traits as a framework.\nWhat’s going well? What barriers might be getting in the way?\nPrinciples Behind Engagement\nWhat do successful contact centers, those with the most engaged employees, have in\ncommon? Here’s a summary of principles I’ve observed:\nWE RESPOND TO A CLEAR, COMPELLING MISSION. A needed first step to\ncreating a motivating environment is to address the “whats” and “whys.” Why do the\norganization and the contact center exist? What are we trying to achieve? What’s in it for\ncustomers? For employees? Shareholders? Other stakeholders?\nIT’S WHAT YOU DO, NOT WHAT YOU SAY, THAT MATTERS. There are countless\norganizations that codify their “official” values, but then encourage an entirely different set of\nbehaviors through their policies and actions. For example, delivering great customer experiences\nmay be the stated objective, but insufficient staffing resources or standards that stress volume-\noriented production may send conflicting messages. When it comes to influence, actions always\nwin out over words.\nEFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION CULTIVATES TRUST. Communication creates\nmeaning and direction. When good communication is lacking, the symptoms are predictable:\nconflicting objectives, unclear values, misunderstandings, lack of coordination, confusion, low\nmorale, and employees doing the bare minimum required to get by. To build and maintain\nengagement, effective leaders keep their teams informed about what’s happening in the\norganization (see Chapter 16).\nGOOD TRAINING AND COACHING IS ESSENTIAL. There’s nothing more stressful\nand frustrating than not knowing what to do in real, live customer service situations (if you’ve"

Confidence is built by providing robust training and coaching (including role-playing\ntough scenarios). When I asked an employee about her company’s improved training and\ncoaching, she said, “I went from dreading my day to looking forward to it; I love being a\nproblem solver!”\nLISTENING ENCOURAGES BUY-IN AND SUPPORT. There is a common myth that\ngreat leaders create compelling visions out of their own genius or from some inner creativity that\nothers don’t possess. But those who have studied leadership point out that the visions of some of\nhistory’s greatest leaders often came from others. Further, when people have a stake in an idea,\nthey tend to work much harder to bring about its success.\nWE TEND TO LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS. Think of your own development over the\nyears. Those coaches, teachers or business mentors who believed in you and expected the most\nprobably weren’t the easiest on you. And they may not have won popularity contests. But they\nbelieved in you, and you reached a little deeper to live up to their expectations.\nSINCERE RECOGNITION GOES A LONG WAY. In study after study, participants say\nthat personalized and sincere recognition from their managers—simply being recognized for\ndoing a good job—is a powerful motivator. (Easier said than done, of course. You have to really\nknow what’s going on from top to bottom to get it right … but isn’t that a part of leadership,\nanyway?)\nACCURATE RESOURCE PLANNING IS ESSENTIAL. Yep, in the time-driven contact\ncenter environment, this matters a lot. We’ve got to have “the right people in the right place at\nthe right times, doing the right things.” When that doesn’t happen, negative things do: queues\nbuild, customers become unhappy, and occupancy goes through the roof. It’s stressful. And, if\nchronic, it zaps motivation and drains the fun out of the environment.\nWHO YOU ARE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY TECHNIQUE YOU USE. We\ntrust and perform for leaders who are predictable on matters of principle, and who make their\npositions known. Unwavering convictions, a sense of fairness, consistency of behavior and\nenacted values, belief in the capabilities of people—these things have much more impact than\nany motivational technique ever could.\nOne thing is certain: leaders in organizations that maintain the highest levels of engagement\ndon’t leave it to chance. They know that employees who are interested in and enthusiastic about\ntheir work create great results for customers and the organization.\nMeaningful Work\nWe don’t all look at work the same way.

Those who view work as a career have a higher\nlevel of motivation—they want to get better at what they do, take on new responsibilities, and\nmove up in the organization. Those who view work as a calling are the most motivated—they\nunderstand how the work they do makes a positive difference for others. So, a secret to creating\nan engaging environment is to establish the connection between what your employees do and\nhow it impacts others.\nHere’s an example. For years, a well-known consumer products company had high turnover\nin their contact center. Customer feedback was poor, and employees jumped at any chance to\nmove to other jobs. This department was second from the bottom in the annual company-wide\nsurvey of employee satisfaction.\nA new director began by asking the team about their value and purpose. One employee\nanswered him this way: we handle consumer gripes all day … how important can that be?\nThey decided to find out. How could they be more valuable to customers and the company?\nSome simple analysis revealed that 11% of customer contacts about a specific cleaning product\nwere due to the cap being too hard to remove. Customers would force it off, too often shearing\noff the spray nozzle. The complaints all went something like this: “Hey, I just spent five bucks\non this and I can’t even use it.”\nThe team shared this data with their packaging supplier, who improved the caps. Those\ncontacts went away and many future customers benefited from a better product. That gave the\nteam a glimpse of their potential. In the months that followed, the contact center became\ninvolved in marketing, systems improvement, and product development. A senior leader told me\nthat the contact center team had become the “secret sauce” to the company’s research and\ndevelopment.\nFast forward a year. Turnover was down to low single digits. Employees were excited. And\nthe department went from second-lowest all the way to second-highest in employee satisfaction.\nWhen they saw their true impact on customers, colleagues, and the success of the company, they\nbegan to understand their value and potential (no, it wasn’t just handling customer gripes all\nday). That made all the difference in their sense of worth and motivation.\nAgent Performance\nThe subject of measuring the performance of individuals has always been hotly debated. And\nfor good reason: performance measurements are usually tied to behavioral expectations and\nstandards, so many issues enter the discussion (e.g., fairness, which measurements are truly\nunder an individual’s control, individual capabilities, drives and motivators, and the effectiveness\nof the processes in place).\nI’ve seen a lot of different performance metrics and standards in play. But there are\nconsistent principles in contact centers that get the best results. Let’s look at how the right"

In fact, many managers viewed contacts handled as virtually synonymous with\nproductivity (not something I’ve ever recommended, for reasons we’ll discuss). While there have\nalways been concerns about sacrificing quality for quantity, contacts handled was the usual\nbenchmark for establishing productivity standards, for comparing performance among agents\nand groups, and for assessing the impact of changes and improvements to the center.\nAs a measure of performance, contacts handled has always been problematic. And not just\nbecause quality can suffer when contacts handled is overemphasized. It’s also this: many of the\nvariables that affect contacts handled are out of the agents’ control. These include random\ncontact arrival, contact types, customers’ knowledge and communication abilities, the accuracy\nof the forecast and schedule, and the adherence to schedule of others in the agent group.\n✽✽✽\nA QUICK QUIZ\nOver which factors do agents have control?\n✔ Adherence to schedule (their own)\n✘ Staff scheduled to handle the workload\n✘ Random contact arrival\n✘ Distribution of long and short contacts\n✘ Distribution of easy and difficult contacts\n✘ Customers’ communication abilities\n✽✽✽\nSeveral mathematical realities are also at work. As discussed in Chapter 9, at a given service\nlevel, small groups are less efficient (have a lower occupancy) than larger groups. Because the\nnumber of contacts is changing throughout the day, so are the average contacts handled for a\ngroup or individuals within a group. Further, as discussed in Chapter 9, when service level goes\nup, occupancy and contacts handled go down."

    "text": "To get around the fairness problem that occupancy creates, some managers convert raw\ncontacts handled into normalized contacts handled (sometimes called “true contacts handled”),\nby dividing contacts handled by percent occupancy. Using the numbers in the table, 5.6 average\ncontacts per agent divided by 65 percent occupancy (first row) is 8.6 normalized contacts. (The\nsame is true for 6.7 contacts divided by 78 percent, 7.7 contacts divided by 90 percent, and 8.1\ncontacts divided by 94 percent.) This is really just another representation of average handling\ntime (1800 seconds in a half hour divided by 210 seconds average handling time is also 8.6).\nAs an alternative, others use statistical control charts to determine whether the process is in\ncontrol, what it’s producing, and which agents, if any, are outside of statistical control. But even\nwith these efforts, “true contacts handled” loses meaning with the variability of new contact\nchannels, skills-based routing, and other capabilities that result in increasingly sophisticated and\nvaried types of interactions.\nFor managers who depended on contacts handled as a performance measure, this left a\nvacuum. Enter the two things that truly matter: being in the right place at the right time\n(adherence to schedule), and doing the right things (quality).\nAdherence to Schedule\nAdherence to schedule is a measure of…I guess this one’s pretty obvious…how well agents\nadhere to the schedule. Many, myself included, don’t particularly care for the tone of the term.\nAnd I don’t like the “big brother” interpretation I sometimes see in contact centers (which\nusually backfires).\nBut the reality is, we’re in time-driven environments. So are stagehands. And astronauts. It\ndoesn’t matter if we have the most incredible knowledge and expertise, if we’re not there when\nwe’re needed.\nAdherence is a measure of how much time during an agent’s shift he or she is handling\ncontacts or is available to handle contacts. If adherence is expected to be 90 percent, each agent\nshould be handling or available to handle contacts .90 × 60 minutes, or 54 minutes per scheduled\nhour (on average).\nWe’re in time-driven environments … It doesn’t matter if we have the most incredible\nknowledge and expertise, if we’re not there when we’re needed."

    "text": "Adherence is based on the time, during an agent’s scheduled shift, that is spent in talk time,\nafter-call work, waiting for contacts to arrive, and anything else (e.g., talking to someone in\nanother department) associated with the contacts themselves. Lunch, breaks, training, work on\nassigned projects and other activities are factored out of the calculation, as the agent is not\nexpected to be handling (or be available to handle) contacts during those times. (Note: be sure to\ndifferentiate the terms “adherence to schedule” and “agent occupancy.” They are two different\nthings. In fact, when adherence to schedule goes up, service level will go up, which drives\noccupancy down. See Chapter 9.)\nAdherence can also incorporate the issue of timing—when was a person available to handle\ncontacts? This is often called “schedule compliance.” The idea is to ensure that agents are\navailable to handle contacts when needed. (In a time-sensitive environment, staying an extra 15\nminutes at the end of a shift doesn’t make up for not being there at the beginning of the shift\nwhen workload was high.)\nAdherence to schedule should be established at levels that are reasonable and that reflect the\nmany things that legitimately keep agents from handling contacts. It should also be flexible (e.g.,\nadjustable downward) when the workload is light. How you approach this topic with agents can make a big difference. I once worked with a\nlarge healthcare organization that set up a resource center that patients could contact 24/7 for\nadvice. At first, the manager got pushback from the employees—nurses and doctors—for\nestablishing schedules, right down to break times. “What is this?” they asked. But as they discussed schedules in a planning meeting, one of the nurses reminded her\ncolleagues that timing was something they were very good at. Every day, they were making\ntime-driven decisions in operating rooms and on hospital floors. I saw heads nodding. They\nrealized that this concept of adherence isn’t so different from what they were all used to, and\nthey now have some of the most effective customer service I’ve seen. Agents cannot control how many contacts are coming in, how challenging customers might\nbe, whether marketing gave the contact center a heads-up on their activities, and so on. But they\ncan be in the right place at the right times. Coupled with good resource plans, that’s huge. Quality\nEnter quality. When well-defined (as they are in all successful contact centers), quality\nstandards and processes dictate, in large part, the amount of time it will take to handle contacts in\nthe manner they should be handled. These standards and processes provide the essential\nparameters to keep contact-handling as focused (as efficient and effective) as possible (without\nrushing, of course). Adherence and quality make a powerful pair."

Note the consistency between individual objectives and the two themes\nthat run throughout contact center management, beginning with the definition introduced in\nChapter 1: service level and quality. Of course, focusing on adherence and quality is not feasible if your standards and metrics are\nvague. They must be implemented fairly, and with foresight and care. With that in mind, let’s\nlook at each in more detail. ✽✽✽\nUNDERSTANDING AVERAGE HANDLING TIME\nI once worked with a technical support center that had a fairly wide range of average handling times (AHTs). Most of the\nagents had AHTs somewhere from 8 to 12 minutes, but the AHT for one agent in the group was over 20 minutes. Their VP of\ncustomer service rightly questioned the range of AHTs (and the very long “outlier”) and wondered, “Is our service as efficient\nand consistent as it should be?”\nAs I wandered around, I noticed that the agent with the long AHT had notes from customers taped to his wall, each thanking\nhim for the great service he provided. Simply forcing a standard—say, to keep AHT to 12 minutes or less—could have caused\nany number of problems. The agent might have become disgruntled and quit. He might have stayed, but with the demoralizing\nview that the company really didn’t care about good service. The VP took an approach that turned out to be very wise. She had several agents, including the one with the particularly\nlong AHT, create a flowchart of a typical customer support interaction. She gathered them in a room with a large conference table\nand gave them index cards and markers. “Work together to write each step you go through on a card and lay them out in order,”\nshe explained. She returned a couple of hours later to find cards neatly laid out from one end of the table to the other. There were also some\ncards (steps) that diverged from the main flow. “What did you learn?” the VP asked. One employee volunteered that he wasn’t\ngoing through some of the same verification steps as others, and wondered whether that could lead to errors. The agent with the\nlong AHT was walking customers through features he felt could be valuable to them. He admitted that he was probably going\nbeyond tech support to provide training. But maybe that’s what they all should be doing? It was a fair question. As a team, they were now empowered with the insight necessary to intelligently discuss how far technical support should\ntake things. I returned a few months later to find much more consistent services, handling times in a tighter range (10 to 12\nminutes, including the agent in question), and employees that were as engaged as ever. In fact, some were involved with cross-\nfunctional efforts to assist with product development and customer training resources."

There will, at times, be negative feedback that has nothing\nto do with the agent—it’s product-, process- or policy-related, and you’ll need to keep that in mind when interpreting results.\nA pervasive challenge in customer surveys is that response rates tend to drop as you ask for additional input. So there’s often\na limit to how much information you can get on specific aspects of quality. That’s where internal observations are so valuable.\nSamples of five to ten interactions per agent per month are common in many organizations.\n✽✽✽\nStandards and Scoring\nThe cornerstone of an effective quality observation process is documenting specific,\nobservable behaviors and tailoring coaching accordingly. There are many types of forms and\nevaluation methods, and many possible scoring methods.\nAn effective way to consider performance (quality) standards is to categorize them as either\n“foundation” or “finesse.” Foundation standards measure whether something was done, and can\nbe assessed with a simple yes or no. For example, the agent uses their name in the greeting. They\nverify the customer’s identification. They use spellcheck in written communication. They code\nthe contact correctly. Yes or no—these things either happened or they didn’t. Foundation\nstandards are objective, consistent, and accomplished the same way by every agent. They are, as\na rule, easy to understand and easy to score.\nFinesse standards, on the other hand, measure how something was done. They are more\nsubjective, allow for style and individuality, and require interpretation. For example, the agent\nlistens carefully and effectively prompts relevant input. They demonstrate professional courtesy.\nThey upsell or cross-sell appropriately. They guide the customer to convenient online resources.\nThey capture needed and useful information for product, process, or service improvements.\nThese standards require clear guidance on what is expected, but performance is along a\ncontinuum.\nAccordingly, common scoring approaches can be categorized as either yes/no or as a\nnumerical range. The yes/no approach (alternately denoted by 1/0) best fits foundation standards.\nOverall results for foundation standards related to an interaction may be expressed by the number\nof yeses and noes (9 Y and 1 N), a fraction (9/10) or a percentage (90%).\nNumerical scoring generally presents a range of possibilities (e.g., 1 to 3), which scorers can\nuse to rate finesse standards (the agent’s proficiency in applying the skill). The wider variety of\nscores possible with a numerical scoring method reveals subtle skill improvements; for example,\nan employee may have some competence in a skill but not yet achieved full mastery.\nFoundation and Finesse Criteria"

In short, your approach should fit your needs.\nBefore you implement a scoring system, consider the following recommendations, which\ncome from ICMI’s quality observation and coaching courses:\n▪ The scoring system should be easy to use and easy to explain.\n▪ The scoring system should emphasize the award of points for positively demonstrated\nskills, rather than deductions for negative behaviors.\n▪ Managers, supervisors, and agents should thoroughly understand how the scoring system\nworks.\n▪ Advise management and agents to keep scores in context. Specific feedback and coaching is\nthe most essential part of the observation and coaching process and is what ultimately improves\nquality. Don’t overemphasize scores.\n▪ Resist the temptation to coach to scores. Scores don’t improve the quality of an interaction;\nspecific feedback and coaching to behaviors do.

A flawed system may underemphasize\ncritical behaviors and overemphasize non-essential skills.\n▪ Confirm the mathematical validity of the scoring system, especially if a total score is\ncompiled or the system is weighted.\n▪ Establish the validity of the system by testing it before it can have an impact on individuals\n(e.g., before scores are included as part of performance-based pay).\n▪ Understand that agents become very interested in scoring systems if they are tied to\nbonuses, performance evaluations and salary reviews. Be prepared to handle their questions and\nconcerns.\n▪ When possible, define variations in specific behaviors associated with a skill and the\ncorresponding scores (e.g., what behaviors earn a 1 or a 3 or a 5?).\n✽✽✽"

What’s not so common, but becoming trendier,\nis dropping the score from those scorecards. That’s what the Navy Federal Credit Union (NFCU) contact center decided to do.\nWith more than seven million members and a contact center of more than four thousand team members, NFCU has many\nopportunities to receive feedback. As Quality Service Manager Kristy Powers explains, “Our Quality Service team wants the\nsame thing for our employees that we want for our members—for them to have a meaningful, personalized experience. With that\nin mind, our Quality Service group embarked on an initiative to transition all teams in the contact center away from a 23-section\nchecklist with multiple forms, to the new one-page, scoreless, behavioral-based model.”\nNFCU’s Quality Partners review five interactions and complete one feedback form per month, per agent, with a focus on\nbehaviors in four key areas:\n▪ Highlights—things that were great\n▪ Opportunities—areas for improvement, along with tips\n▪ Areas of focus—priorities to focus on right away\n▪ Resources—links to internal and external resources that can help the agent gain skills\nAgents now focus on the content of the feedback, versus things that must happen to earn “points.” The result? Improved\nquality and higher employee and member satisfaction. (And the icing on the cake was an ICMI Global Contact Center Awards\ntrophy for Best QA/Customer Experience.)\nKristy says, “Everything we do, every single day, is done with the goal of providing effortless experiences and wow-worthy\nservice. Our member experience scores are one of our primary benchmarks of success. We view our QA process as a vital tool to\nevaluate where we’re doing well and identify any opportunities for improvement that can help us achieve an ever-higher level of\nmember satisfaction.”\nSource: “Want to Improve Quality?

When high levels of calibration are achieved, it doesn’t\nmatter who does the assessment and scoring, or who facilitates coaching—the approach and the\noutcome will be the same.\nCalibration is an important tool for ensuring consistency in interpreting performance.

It allows the coaching process to focus on achievements and\nimprovement opportunities rather than agents’ concerns about whether scores are accurate or\nfair.\nThere are four levels of successful calibration:\n▪ Overall agreement on the interaction"

    "text": "▪ Ratings are consistent for each quality standard\n▪ Coaching is calibrated—there’s agreement on what to coach\n▪ Internal ratings are calibrated with customer input\nA common way to begin calibration is to have those who do quality evaluations\nindependently score several of the same interactions. In contact centers, these are usually\nrecorded interactions. If you do not have recorded interactions, you can use alternatives such as\nrole-play scenarios or observations.\nYou then compare the results. First, check for overall agreement on how interactions went\n(the first level of calibration). You can then compare scores for specific quality criteria (the\nsecond level of calibration). If, at this point, there is disagreement—if scores vary—you’ll need\nto discuss interpretation. If that doesn’t get you there, you’ll need to revamp the standards or\ndescriptions of them until you reach consistent interpretation.\nThe third level of calibration, and one fewer organizations achieve, is in the consistency and\neffectiveness of coaching. Research shows that employees want to know what’s expected of their\nperformance, where they stand, and how they can improve. This spans all generations, including\nthose just entering the workforce. But if completely different conversations take place, efforts to\nimprove quality begin to break down.\nAn often-overlooked or under-utilized benefit of calibration is that it improves the skills of\ncoaches. This outcome requires that a skilled facilitator (ideally, a “consummate coach”) leads\nthe calibration. Once the team agrees on an overall score for an interaction, the facilitator should\nwork with the team to gain agreement on what should be coached—specifically, which\nperformance standards were well-demonstrated and which need to be improved. It’s helpful to\nthen role-play what the coaching conversation might sound like.\nCalibrated coaching can also provide powerful insight into hiring and training practices. For\nexample, what are the skills, knowledge, and behaviors you’re looking for in job candidates, and\nhow can you best focus training on ensuring your team is prepared?\nThe fourth level of calibration is to compare internal assessments with customer input. Do\nthese metrics align? Are you and your customers on the same page about what’s important? Few\norganizations achieve 100% alignment of internal and external scores. But scores should be\ndirectionally the same. You want to ensure that your priorities reflect those of your customers.\nMy recommendation: calibration should be an ongoing activity. The most effective\norganizations have working calibration sessions at least quarterly. In addition to ensuring\nconsistency and fairness, these organizations use calibration sessions to look for quality trends\nand prioritize improvements.\n✽✽✽"

    "text": "BLUE-RIBBON QUALITY AT DELTA DENTAL\nSupervisors often ask, “How do we get agents to embrace the feedback given during coaching sessions?” Delta Dental of\nMichigan, an affiliate of the largest dental plan system in the United States, implemented a color rating system as part of quality\nobservation and coaching.\nBlue is awarded for superior demonstration of a skill or for going above and beyond for a member—it is like earning a blue\nribbon. Green, yellow and red round out the scoring colors. Ideally, the scorecard for an agent is mostly green and blue. When\nyellow or red crops up in a consistent pattern, it is quickly identified so the agent and the supervisor can work together to build\nthe needed knowledge or skill.\nIn ongoing town hall meetings, agents listen to a recorded call. Asked to provide an overall reaction, attendees raise the\ncolored flag of their choice. Several are given the opportunity to share why they chose the color they did and what, in their\nopinion, could have been done differently to make the contact deserve a “blue ribbon.” There is active participation during these\nsessions and agents challenge each other to raise the bar.\nCarmen Schmuecker, Director of Command Center, shares, “Agents who once disliked listening to their calls now look\nforward to the feedback from their coaches. They can look at quality scorecards and immediately identify areas of opportunity.”\nThe quality of interactions has gone from “strong to fabulous.”\nBy Laura Grimes, Senior Certified Business Associate, ICMI\n✽✽✽\nCoaching\nWhen effective, coaching is something your agents will want and will look forward to. (Yes,\nit is possible!) And in the most-engaged teams I’ve seen, there are five essential ingredients.\nFirst, coaching is a relationship, NOT an event. The best coaches build relationships of trust,\nrespect, and accountability. They help clarify goals, serve as role models, and provide positive\nreinforcement.\nSecond, coaching has far more impact when it’s supported by clear quality standards. Your\nstandards should be understood and interpreted consistently. And this works in both directions;\nquality standards guide coaching, and coaching, in turn, helps your employees consistently\ndeliver services that reflect your standards.\nThird, all of your coaches should use a proven coaching model. There are many to choose\nfrom. As one example, ICMI recommends a simple framework that can be remembered by the\nletters SAFE:\n▪ Summarize observed behavior in the context of quality standards.\n▪ Ask the employee for their input on how things went.\n▪ Formulate a plan with them for addressing performance gaps and opportunities.\n▪ Express thanks for their time and input."

But whether you use this model or another, it’s\nessential that there’s agreement on what will be coached.\nFourth, effective coaching focuses on the toughest and most important challenges. For\nexample:\n▪ What does it mean to really listen and understand customers?\n▪ How do you find the best solutions for customer issues?\n▪ How can you turn around tough customers or successfully handle particularly complex\nissues?\nOrganizations that do a great job with these challenges create scenarios and role plays. You\nwon’t be able to anticipate or train on every unique issue that comes along, so your employees\nwill need to know how to make good decisions. That takes practice.\nFinally, approach training, coaching, and performance standards as opportunities to empower\nyour agents to coach themselves. Self-coaching is the talk each person has with himself or\nherself as service is delivered day by day and moment by moment. For self-coaching to be\neffective, each person should have a deep understanding of the organization’s mission, values,\nand quality standards. They must also be empowered to make good, in-the-moment decisions\n(see Chapter 11).\nHow effective is coaching in your organization? I encourage you to check it against these\nfive traits.\nGetting the Most from Your Quality Program\nChances are your contact center has made significant investments in quality observation. You\nprobably have spent hundreds of combined hours and tens of thousands of dollars developing\ncriteria, investigating legal requirements, and orienting agents and supervisors to the program.\nAnd it’s likely that quality observation and related coaching activities take more combined time\nthan any other activity except handling the customer workload.\nBut are you getting the results you should from your quality program? As discussed in the\nprevious chapter, there’s far more to handling customer contacts than improving the satisfaction\nof those customers, as important as that is. As a primary customer touchpoint, the contact center\nhas significant potential to provide other business units with valuable intelligence and insight.\nOrganizations that get the most leverage out of these efforts share some common characteristics:\nTHEY ALIGN QUALITY OBSERVATION WITH KEY BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.\nThere’s a common understanding within the organization that the contact center has a larger\nmission than just handling customer interactions. So it makes sense that effective quality\nprograms—whether they employ low-tech listening, recordings or high-tech analytics—are\ndesigned to do much more than assist with individual training and development. They also focus\non leveraging the knowledge gathered from contacts into better systems, processes and services"

    "text": "across the organization. In short, the most effective centers identify issues that are beyond the\ncenter’s scope but still need to be addressed or fixed. THEY INCORPORATE QUALITY CRITERIA THAT SUPPORT BROAD\nIMPROVEMENTS. These include capturing needed and useful information, detecting and\ndocumenting unsolicited marketplace feedback, assessing whether contacts could have been\nprevented, and encouraging (and sharing) customer insight that helps design better products and\nservices. (The organizations recognize that accomplishing these objectives is not within the\ndirect control of those handling interactions, but must be identified at the point of contact.)\nTHEY CORRELATE QUALITY OBSERVATIONS WITH OTHER KEY RESULTS. For example, they compare how quality observation results compare to customer satisfaction,\ncustomer sentiment in social media channels, employee satisfaction, service levels, revenues, and\ncosts. Are there correlations, and how strong are they? Better understanding how the\norganization’s mission is related to contact center activities and results will lead to significant\nimprovements and innovations. THEY REGULARLY CALIBRATE FOR FAIRNESS AND CONSISTENCY. Does\nyour quality program reflect what is really happening in a consistent and unbiased way? To find\nout, conduct a simple experiment. Have those who do the evaluations independently score five to\nten recorded interactions. Then compare the results. If the scores are significantly different, take\nthe system back to the shop for a tune-up or complete overhaul. Until you do, you’ll be getting\nmixed results and wasting time and effort. Or worse, you’ll be alienating agents who don’t trust\nthe results and who aren’t getting the recognition or help they need. THEY ACTIVELY SUPPORT TRAINING. Elaine Carr, who is a group instructional\ndesign manager at ICMI, cautions, “We see again and again where people show up for training\nwith no idea what the training is about or why they are attending. This sometimes leads to\nresentment that they even have to attend training. On the other hand, if your manager tells you\nabout the training and the two of you set some learning goals, you’re going to be pretty\nmotivated.”\nTHEY INVOLVE AGENTS IN ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. It’s become a recognized\n(and true!) tenet of the quality movement that those closest to the work know and understand it\nbest. Your agents are in an ideal position to help define what constitutes a quality experience for\ncustomers, and how processes, training, systems, and interdepartmental coordination can be\nimproved. Agent involvement also encourages ownership and engagement, and it improves\nagents’ job satisfaction. The Complementary Roles of Hiring, Training, and Coaching\nAs is often pointed out, the best contact centers do a great job of hiring, training, and\ncoaching. But the point that is sometimes understated is the degree to which these processes\ndepend on and benefit each other. Consider hiring."

Some underlying trends have resulted in training becoming increasingly important. One is\nthat the environment is becoming more complex, requiring robust training that provides a strong\nand effective knowledge base for agents. A more subtle trend is that many managers are placing\ngreater emphasis on finding agents who support and further the culture of the organization and\nthen training them on appropriate skills, rather than finding those with the right skills but who\nmay not fit as well culturally. Effective coaching is an in-the-trenches, hands-on activity, directly focused on specific\nproblems, solutions, and opportunities. In coaching, there’s no hiding from the issues or glossing\nover the details. Coaching provides valuable insight into the hiring process by helping identify\nthe traits of agents who perform best.

Training has the best chance of success, and will deliver the highest ROI, when:\n▪ Training is, in fact, the right solution for the situation. Training can’t “fix” people who are fundamentally wrong for the\njob. ▪ The reason for training has been communicated to the target audience. Do participants know what the training is about and\nwhy they are there? ▪ You’ve done some pre-planning. It’s powerful to have agents come to training with a checklist or summary of goals,\nespecially when they had a part in creating it around an understood and shared set of objectives. ▪ You reinforce training after it happens. Training can facilitate learning new skills and knowledge, but it won’t stick without\npractice and reinforcement. ▪ You deliver refresher training as needed. (Example: training new agents on adherence and other performance metrics is\ngreat, but they will need one or more refreshers as they settle in.)\n▪ Training is relevant to the job, the center, the customer and the organization. ▪ The trainer/facilitator understands the goals and objectives for the training, as well as the target audience."

How does the reality of overlapping responsibilities (discussed in Chapter 12)\ntranslate into performance standards for individuals and teams? Every person has a direct impact\non contact center performance objectives. But is it fair to set performance standards on things\nthat are outside the direct control of an individual?\nIn principle—and in practice—the answers are fairly simple. Managers, by definition, are\nresponsible for achieving results through other people. Consequently, senior-level managers and\ndirectors are generally held responsible for the full set of performance objectives that the\norganization establishes. Of course, they shouldn’t be held accountable for objectives that are in\nconflict or that are mutually exclusive. And they can only accomplish what is possible within the\ncontext of the resources they have to work with. But, in general, they answer for overall results.\nManagers and analysts in supporting roles are in a similar situation. However, more specific\nresponsibilities and accountabilities are associated with their primary areas of authority. For\nexample, the workforce manager in charge of forecasting and scheduling is accountable for the\naccuracy of the forecast even though it is influenced by many variables, people, and departments\noutside of his or her immediate control. Given overlapping responsibilities, successful centers\nwork hard to educate everyone on the interrelated nature of processes and the impact each person\nhas on results, while still establishing key areas of accountability.\nAs you establish accountabilities, keep your eye on the big picture.

Take internal agent attrition, for example.\nIf employees leave for other positions within the organization, the contact center will have\nexperienced advocates in other departments. And turnover can create the means for the center to\nbring in additional employees with needed skills and fresh insights.\nThe causes and costs/benefits will vary by type of turnover. For example, voluntary external\nturnover is more of a detriment to the organization than planned internal turnover. For better or\nworse, turnover will have an impact on your center. Given the significant cost of low quality and\nproductivity, it is necessary to track and manage turnover as aggressively as other important\nperformance indicators.\nExample: Input for Calculating Turnover\nCalculating Turnover\nTo measure turnover correctly, you’ll need to calculate an annualized turnover rate, which\nprovides a consistent basis for comparison and trending. An annualized number does not require\n12 months’ worth of data. The calculation is as follows:\n(Number of agents exiting the job ÷ average number of agents during the period) × (12\n÷ number of months in the period)"

(Internal turnover\nrefers to employees who leave the contact center but stay within the organization. External\nturnover refers to employees who leave the organization entirely.) Their respective causes\nusually differ, so this enables the manager to react and plan accordingly.\nCategorizing Turnover\nTo take your analysis one step further, determine when each kind of turnover happens (e.g.,\nwithin 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 6 months, 12 months). You can also analyze attrition by skill\nset, supervisor, shift hours and other factors. “I slice and dice it as many ways as I can because\nsometimes the root cause is hidden,” says consultant Laura Grimes. “That almost always leads to\nclues about root causes and factors you can address.”\n✽✽✽\nCOMMON CAUSES OF TURNOVER\n(no specific order)\n▪ Better opportunities within or outside the organization\n▪ Insufficient development opportunities\n▪ Pace of effort required\n▪ Frustration with supervisor/manager\n▪ Repetition\n▪ Over-regimentation"

Problems are often\nby-products of a poor planning process, so they assess and address resource issues. These contact\ncenters are also broadening the responsibilities that agents have and their opportunities to learn,\ngrow and advance (see discussion on career paths, Chapter 16).\nOne powerful tool in improving retention and deepening employee engagement is the “stay\ninterview.” Dick Finnegan, author of The Power of Stay Interviews for Engagement and\nRetention, describes a stay interview as “a structured discussion a leader conducts with each\nindividual employee to learn the specific actions she must take to strengthen that employee’s\nengagement and retention with the organization.” I’ve found stay interviews to be informative\nand inspiring—and they underscore a key principle: retention is an important leadership\nresponsibility.\nI’ve noticed a shift in perspective on internal turnover (people leaving the contact center for\nother opportunities within the organization). In many ways, it’s a good thing. The time people\nspend on the front lines with customers gives them a healthy perspective that they carry into\nother departments. But there has to be a balance. Losing people too soon can cost the contact\ncenter, and the organization, dearly.\nConsequently, a growing number of contact center managers are working to lengthen the\ntime agents spend in the center before moving elsewhere in the organization. As part of that, they\nare helping agents see the enormous impact the center can have on the organization and customer\nbase, as well as the exciting future ahead as communications change and trends such as social"

Go back with me—\nfor just a moment—to how we got here. Let’s start in 1858, 15 years after Samuel B. Morse\nintroduced the telegraph (Chapter 1). After more than a year of enduring storms, sickness and\nfailures on the high seas, the crew of HMS Agamemnon completed running the first transatlantic\ntelegraph cable. Investors on both sides of the Atlantic had provided the funding, and hopes for\nthe beginnings of a new communications era were high.\nUnfortunately, the signals that trickled through the cable were so weak that it took over 16\nhours and the most sensitive equipment available to decipher the first message (which,\nincidentally, was 90 words sent by Queen Victoria). Worse, the cable’s insulation failed several\ndays later, and the telegraph never worked again. For onlookers, investors, and especially the\ncrew, this was a heartbreaking and bitter end to an immense and bold undertaking. But the\nproject—though viewed as a failure at the time—helped to establish a vision of a more\nconnected world.\n“A plate of silver and one of zinc are taken into the mouth, the one above, the other\nbelow the tongue. They are then placed in contact with the wire, and words issuing from the\nmouth are conveyed by the wire.”\n1854 NEWSPAPER, DESCRIBING HOW THE YET-TO-BE-INVENTED\nTELEPHONE MIGHT WORK\nIt wasn’t until almost a century later, in 1956, that the first transatlantic telephone cable was\ninaugurated, running between the British Isles and Newfoundland, Canada. The crew and\ninvestors of 1858 would be amazed to see what has transpired since. High-capacity fiber optic\ncables crisscross oceans and continents, and satellite transmissions reach homes and businesses\nin the most remote parts of the globe. With more than five billion subscriptions, mobile services\nprovide connectivity virtually everywhere.\nAs I write, I’m in San Diego—but could just as easily be in Seoul, São Paulo, or\nSouthampton.

    "text": "in the making.\nOf course, the development of our global communications network has led to more than just\nthe ability to connect. A key part of the equation is the way information and services are digitally\nrepresented and transported.\nConsider a familiar example: digital photography. You can snap a picture on your\nsmartphone, post it to Instagram, text a link to Grandma, and use it as the home screen image on\nyour phone. Similarly, music can be downloaded, edited, transferred to a portable player, used as\nthe ringtone on your mobile device, and easily played through your car or the speakers you bring\nto the beach.\nPictures, music, calls, messaging, video, television, movies, games (you name it) have been\nforever freed from the rigid technical confines of the past. Everything is digital—let’s call that\nphase two.\nIf it’s all digital, any of these media can be integrated to create new services. Let’s call\nGrandma—by video of course—and show her San Diego’s Old Town, the park we’re visiting. In\nfact, let’s set a few pictures and video clips to music (Mariachi would be perfect) and share it\nwith the rest of the family…it will just take a moment. We can refer to the integration of digital\nmedia with other services as phase three.\nOh, and about San Diego, someone mentioned a fascinating documentary that contrasts the\ndifferent cultures of the region. The gift shop features a collector’s set on Blu-ray … or, wait, I’ll\ngo online and we can stream it to any device. And on the topic of online, it’s nice to know these\npriceless pictures are being backed up automatically. We can refer to these capabilities as phase\nfour: cloud-based or hosted services.\nSpeaking of cloud, it’s getting cloudy—should we expect showers? Let me ask Siri…Good,\nit’s clearing and will be a perfect 76° this afternoon. Let’s call this phase five: AI-enabled\ncapabilities that understand language, provide information, and even help with a forecast.\nInfrastructure Evolution\nI’ve seen a similar progression in contact centers. As the world became connected, contact\ncenters began to spring up out of the customer expectation for services “on demand.”\nLet’s start at the birth of the “modern” contact center. Two developments in the late 1960s\nand early 1970s launched contact centers as we recognize them today. Toll-free “800 service”\nwas introduced in 1967 and the automatic call distributor (ACD)—now more accurately"

Those advancements\nprovided the basic capabilities contact centers still very much depend on: identify, route and\ndistribute customer contacts to a pool of cross-trained agents. In short, make connections\nbetween customers and someone who can help.\nIntegrated voice and data first became possible through “computer telephony integration”\n(CTI), introduced in the late 1980s. CTI enabled screen pops (simultaneous voice and data\ndelivery), database-driven call-routing, integrated performance reporting, and a host of other\ncapabilities. But CTI was transitional, an attempt to bring together what were still two separate\nworlds: voice and data. And it was expensive and required a significant amount of programming,\nmaking it impractical to implement for many contact centers.\nThe migration of traditional circuit-switching based on time-division multiplexing (TDM) to\npacket-switching based on Internet protocol (IP) brought fundamental change to contact centers.\nWhat were essentially two sets of technologies—one for voice, one for data—became part of the\nsame platform of services. That opened up all kinds of new capabilities.\nIP-enabled services also helped usher in the next phase of development: hosted or cloud-\nbased services. (Contact centers use a number of terms to describe these services, including\ncloud-based contact center, hosted contact center, virtual contact center, and contact center as a\nservice or CCaaS.) Virtually any capability available in premise-based (on site) equipment and\nsoftware can be “rented” and delivered through the cloud, leaving much of the development and\nmany of the maintenance activities to the supplier.\nThe benefits of today’s IP- and cloud-based technologies are significant, including:\n▪ OMNICHANNEL. All channels (e.g., voice, chat, text, video, social media) can be\nintegrated and handled by a common routing and reporting system. True omnichannel enables\nthe customer and agent to move from one channel to the next, with reports maintaining a holistic\nview of the experience.\n▪ VIRTUAL. Anyone who is part of the organization’s network—including agents working\nfrom home, and colleagues in other departments or across the globe—can be part of the contact\ncenter, whether routinely or on an as-needed basis.\n▪ SCALABLE. Adding or reducing agents is (compared with the past) simple and cost-\neffective, with minimal technology impact.\n▪ SIMPLIFIED MANAGEMENT. Moving to IP architecture can result in fewer, more\ntightly integrated systems that are far easier to manage than separate systems.\n▪ INTEGRATED REPORTS. With activities consolidated within one architecture, reports\ncan provide a more holistic perspective of contacts and customers across sites and channels.\n▪ DISASTER BACKUP. If set up correctly, IP-based architecture and cloud-based services\nprovide “redundancy” (backup) to ensure business continuity in the case of a natural (or other)\ndisaster."

All things being equal, the costs to purchase, use and maintain IP-\nbased systems are often lower than for the separate systems of the past. In short, today’s IP- and cloud-based services have opened up opportunity for organizations\nof virtually any size to build contact centers that are feature-rich, scalable, and cost-effective. When you think about capabilities that were once available to only the largest organizations now\nbeing accessible to a five- or ten-person contact center—wow, the competitive implications are\nvery interesting! Now, this all sounds pretty rosy, right? You may be thinking, “Great, but our organization is\nnot ‘there’ yet.”\nI get it. Many organizations aren’t there yet. For all the advantages of IP- and cloud-based\ncapabilities, and for all the benefits that AI is beginning to deliver, many organizations still have\na somewhat disjointed combination of new and old systems. I can think of several I’m working\nwith who are, right now, in the middle of significant digital transformation initiatives, with one\nof the goals being to transition away from “legacy” (old) systems they’ve had for many years. This is not an all-at-once leap for most. The truth is that changing systems is costly, with expenses going far beyond the systems\nthemselves to data migration, compatibility issues, training, and the like. What you have may be\nworking just fine for now. You and your team will need to take a good look at your current\ncapabilities, what you require and how you’ll get there. You’ll need a technology roadmap. Let’s look at developments in specific areas. Some will weigh heavily into your priorities. Routing: Getting the Right Contacts to the Right Places\nThe efficiencies contact centers can bring to an organization have always stemmed largely\nfrom how customer contacts are routed and distributed. Prior to call centers, the “clientele\napproach” was prevalent: customers tended to ask for and talk to the same representatives, whom\nthey reached through a switchboard operator or by dialing a direct number. It was not very\nefficient. When ACDs arrived in the early 1970s, they challenged existing thinking. Rather than send\ncalls to individuals, ACDs could automatically connect calls to a group of “pooled” agents who\nwere trained to handle a variety of customer issues. Shared computer systems and information\nalso played important roles in this concept. In short, the \"powerful pooling principle\" became the\ncore of contact center efficiency\nBut the pooling principle is only powerful if agents are effectively cross-trained to handle the\nvariety of contacts that come their way. Most organizations have more than one agent group—\nsometimes many—geared around specific types of interactions, channels, or areas of specialized\nexpertise."

Customer information, agent availability,\nworkload conditions and many other parameters can be included in the criteria. Skills-based\nrouting, which entered the market in the early 1990s, makes it possible to route individual\ncontacts to specific agents (see Chapter 7). Analytics and AI-driven applications can also help\nget contacts to the right places. The “vision” (still a work in progress for many) is for one single\nrouting application to handle all interactions and channels across the contact center’s operations.\nA single routing engine does not mean that you must use universal agents (“super agents”) to\nhandle everything—that’s for you to decide. Instead, the criteria you define dictate how contacts\nare delivered and handled. The degree to which your center is “pooled” or “specialized” depends\non the criteria you establish.\n✽✽✽\nIdentifying Customers and What They Need\nTo implement customized routing and contact-handling protocols, you’ll need to know who your customers are and what\nthey need when they contact your organization (see Chapter 7). Common identification methods include:\n▪ Customer-entered information (e.g., into an IVR, speech system, webpage or mobile app), which can be matched to\nservices desired or specific customer records\n▪ ANI (automatic number identification), the number the call originated from, which can often be matched to customer\nrecords in a database\n▪ DNIS (dialed number identification services), the telephone number the customer dials, which can indicate the reason for\nthe contact, language preference, etc.\n▪ Email recipient address, subject line, sender’s address or customer-entered data, which can be matched to services desired\nor customer records\n▪ Web address, social media name, or demographic information (e.g., location), which can be matched to services desired or\ncustomer records\n▪ TTY (text telephone) capabilities, which enable your organization to receive, verify, route and handle contacts from\ncustomers who are hearing-impaired\n▪ Analytics and AI-enabled bots, which can decipher voice- or text-based conversations to determine the best routing options\n(See GM Leverages AI in Social Customer Care.)\n✽✽✽\nBoosting Productivity and Quality"

Again, the underlying themes include architecture based on open standards, ability\nto integrate with other systems, flexibility, and maximum user control. Examples include:\nWORKFORCE OPTIMIZATION SYSTEMS. At a basic level, workforce management\nsystems (now generally referred to as workforce optimization systems) provide automated tools\nfor forecasting, staff calculations, schedules, tracking and reporting. In recent years, applications\nhave become increasingly good at handling these core processes. For example, forecasting and\nscheduling for the full range of contact channels, along with skills-based scheduling and user-\ndefined reports that integrate with other systems, have supported the emerging omnichannel\nenvironment. Administration of these systems has become much easier, with far better integration with\npayroll and financial systems. Integration with quality observation systems and training tools has\nbecome robust, enabling seamless forecasting, scheduling, and real-time management of\nvirtually any contact center activity (including activity not directly related to handling customer\ninteractions). One of the most useful developments has been improvements in modules that\nenable what-if analysis for budgeting and resource decisions. And the real crowd-pleaser has\nbeen empowering agents to manage their own schedules. QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. At a basic level, quality management systems\nrecord interactions and enable review for quality improvement purposes. Many systems can be\nset up to record all interactions or a sampling of interactions. Both voice and screen (how the\nagent enters data) activities can be captured and, increasingly, all contact channels can be\nincluded. Integration with other systems can provide rich, three-dimensional reports on activities,\nhelp with coaching and training, and link to elearning modules that are geared around individual\nperformance evaluations. Supervisors can insert voice annotations into original recordings for\ntraining purposes and managers can include specific contacts in reports delivered to senior\nmanagement, colleagues in other departments, or others. But the benefits go far beyond those associated with recording and reviewing contacts. Analytics—speech and text—has been a hot trend in contact centers, and for good reason. Analytics can identify problem areas, trends, and customer sentiment. This insight enables the\nbroader organization to improve products, services, and processes (see Lutron’s Insight Center,\nChapter 13). CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP CAPABILITIES.

For example, he says that in the near future:\n▪ AI will drive cars, but won’t be able to comfort your daughter after a romantic breakup.\n▪ AI will find answers to customer questions, but won’t be able to empathize with a customer\nwho just lost their house in a tornado.\n▪ AI will crunch a lot of data to identify underlying patterns, but won’t be able to figure out\nwhat kind of data to crunch.\nAI is real and powerful, but many of the effective applications I’m seeing are not grabbing\nheadlines.

They are forever changing customer expectations and services. Customers not only invest a combined billions of dollars annually to acquire devices and\napps, they make the effort to learn and use them.

As industry pioneer (and my\nformer business partner at ICMI) Gordon MacPherson Jr. foresaw three decades ago, “A new\nbreed of technology-sophisticated consumers is demanding a choice of how they will be served.\nThey often know what the choices could be, and they will become increasingly critical if you do\nnot offer the choices they think you should offer.”\nIt’s up to you to open up and develop access and services as technologies and expectations\nevolve. All channels have a place. An agent won’t suffice when you want to review feedback\nfrom a diverse social media community. Speech recognition doesn’t illustrate movement in a\nfinancial market. Web-based services don’t come close to matching the proficiency of an\nexperienced technical support agent. Your customers and their specific situations will dictate the\nbest combination of channels, services, and technology.\n\"We think we invent technology, but technology also invents us.”\nRICHARD FARSON\nYou’ll Always Need Agents—But for Different Reasons\nQuite a few industry pundits predicted that advanced self-service capabilities (along with a\nfocus on simpler and more reliable products and services) would dramatically reduce reliance on\nagents. More recently, I’ve heard similar predictions from observers who are looking at\ndevelopments in AI. Yet, there are more agents working in more contact centers across the globe\nthan at any time in history. The consideration missing in much of the analysis is that\ncommunications capabilities are creating new services and expectations. This is not a zero-sum\ngame.\nFor those services that require the involvement of an agent, customers expect their issues to\nbe resolved quickly and easily (see discussion of expectations, Chapter 2). This is putting a\nspotlight on the importance of agent empowerment. “Customers expect frontline employees to\nresolve problems on the spot,” write John Goodman and Scott Broetzmann in their eye-opening\nbook, Strategic Customer Service. “This requires much more empowerment than companies are\ntypically willing to impart. However, if you look at the cost of supervisor involvement to make a\ndecision that will be the same 92 percent of the time, tripling the cost, it is cheaper to trust the\nfrontline employee. Further, if you add the 10 to 20 percent drop in loyalty by forcing the\ncustomer to wait, and otherwise gumming up the works, the case for immediate resolution and\ntrusting the frontline staff becomes compelling.”\n✽✽✽"

    "text": "THE CONTACT CENTER’S ROLE IN BUILDING SELF-SERVICE\nMany organizations are learning firsthand that contact centers play a central role in encouraging and supporting low-cost\naccess channels. For example, the contact center can provide a wealth of information about which contacts can be automated or\nhandled in customer communities, and what can be done to improve customer acceptance of this type of handling. While it may\nseem paradoxical, providing agent assistance when and as needed encourages customer confidence in these alternatives. Here are some things you can do to build self-service channels:\n▪ Equip agents to educate customers on self-service options. They should be trained on the uses and advantages of these\nalternatives so that they can encourage customers to avail themselves of self-service options when appropriate. ▪ Collect and analyze data about contacts currently handled in the center. Look for opportunities to provide self-service\nfeatures or to build communities that enable customers to help each other. ▪ Observe agents handling contacts. Your best agents really know how to serve customers; watching them work can present\nmany opportunities for developing and improving self-service systems. ▪ Involve agents in system design. Your agents should actively serve on project teams responsible for building self-service\nsystems. They can also help monitor and test systems and interpret customer behavior and feedback. ▪ Integrate self-service and contact center systems. Integrated systems can enable agents to use the information captured in\nself-service applications when they are assisting customers. ▪ Capture customer feedback about self-service systems. This information is essential to improving system design. ▪ Enable customers to easily reach agents. If customers can’t reach an agent when they want to, they will resent being forced\nto use self-service systems. ▪ Track data from all support modes and analyze it for improvement opportunities; specifically, why do customer contacts\nhappen? Which do you want to encourage and which do you want to prevent (as much as possible)? If your contact center agents view self-service as a low-cost replacement for humans, they may not be overly enthusiastic\nabout helping to improve those systems or encouraging their use. Turn this (misconception) on its head and you’ll be correctly\npositioning self-service systems as an essential part of providing choices and delivering high-value services. ✽✽✽\nAgent-Assisted Services Are Being Prioritized\nMany of the contacts being handled today can be, will be and should be handled by self-\nservice channels, emerging AI applications, and related options in coming years. This doesn’t\nmean that agents are, or will be, obsolete. Consider the travel sector. Every time an airline or hotel closes a reservation center\nsomewhere, journalists jump on the story—“Is the contact center industry in decline? Is this\nrepresentative of a broader pattern?” Short answer: no."

And leading contact centers are taking a proactive role in this\neffort. They are ensuring that their highly trained, highly paid agents are handling interactions\nthat need the human touch. Contact Centers Require Increasingly High Levels of Skill\nAgents face a number of challenges as search, online resources, social media communities\nand self-service technologies offload relatively simple contacts, and as products and services\ngrow increasingly diverse and complex. In addition to handling more difficult interactions, they\nmust serve increasingly well-informed and varied customers; adjust to rapid changes in products,\nservices, and technologies; operate in a time-sensitive, multimedia environment; communicate\nquickly and accurately in both verbal and written form; and understand (and be able to help\ncustomers use) technology-based services. At supervisory and management levels, the traditional “jack of all trades” roles are being\ndivided among specialists doing, among other things, data analysis, scheduling, quality\nobservation, and coaching. Some organizations have created contact center application\nspecialists, who interact directly with IT or suppliers. Evolving technologies are powerful and\nenormously flexible, but they are contributing to the emergence of specialized managers with the\nexpertise to understand, manage and maintain those technologies. An undeniable trend fueling further complexity is the addition of new channels and\ncombinations of channels. While the core principles of effective management are timeless and\nuniversal, the operational specifics vary from one channel to another (see Chapter 7). And\nrequirements at the agent level vary, even though the products and services being supported are\nsimilar. Phone, chat, text, video, and different social media platforms present nuances in cultural\nexpectations and skill requirements. Organizations Are Being Redefined\nMany organizations are restructuring so that the customer experience is viewed more\nholistically, and so that all touchpoints are approached cohesively (see Chapter 16). This can\nnecessitate significant internal structural change that involves IT, marketing, HR and virtually\nevery other department. Job roles are changing along with organizational structures. Many organizations are also\nestablishing an overall head of customer experience. As discussed in Chapters 13, 14 and 16, it is\nincreasingly important that organizations invest in employees and provide attractive skill and\ncareer paths. Many organizations are also becoming more broadly-based. Multi-site centers and\nagents based at home have increased in number significantly in recent years."

The late Peter Drucker contended that the most important impact of\ninformation technology is not the capabilities of the technologies themselves, but that these\nsystems force you to organize processes and information more logically.\nAuthor Emily Yellin once summarized the opportunity this way: “Our billions of everyday\ntransactions are both simpler and more complicated than they appear.

Example: recording systems that enable interactions to\nbe captured and stored for a defined period of time.\nReturn on investment, where potential benefits exceed costs based on the organization’s accepted ROI approach (e.g.,\npayback time, return on capital). Example: desktop capabilities that enable agents to access needed information more quickly,\nreducing handling times and boosting first contact resolution.\nIntangible, providing benefits that are more difficult to quantify but are believed to be worth more than the cost.

It’s essential to develop a sound customer access strategy and use it to guide decisions (see\nChapter 2).

For example, I helped an insurance company with agent group “consolidation.”\nTheir sales team would sell an account to a major client and, if pressed, would agree to provide a dedicated agent group. After\neach sale, the contact center would be left to figure out how to provide those dedicated resources.\nThe center pooled agent groups whenever possible, but they eventually reached the point at which they faced the near-\nimpossible task of managing numerous agent groups, routing plans, overflow contingencies and access numbers. The purpose of\nthe consolidation plan was to get a handle on all of the available access numbers and routing plans, and combine and simplify as\nmuch as possible. It was a painful effort, driven by decisions made in the absence of an overall plan. The contact center and sales\nteams now work from a common plan—leading to a cleaner and more effective organization, one that delivers far better customer\nexperiences.\n✽✽✽\nAGENT GROUPS FORM THE FOUNDATION OF CONTACT CENTER\nSTRUCTURE. Once the contact center’s place in the larger organization is defined, it should be\nbuilt from agent groups upward. (Recall from Chapter 6 that agent groups share a common set of\nskills and knowledge, handle a specified mix of contacts, and can comprise a small number of\nagents in a single location, or hundreds of agents across multiple sites.)\nIn an ideal world, every agent in a center would be equally proficient at handling every type\nof contact through any channel, speak all required languages, and maintain the company’s\nbranding and image for every customer segment. That, of course, is not realistic in most\nenvironments—thus the tiered groups, skills-based routing and other alternatives that centers use\nto get the right contact to the right agent at the right time.\nHere’s the point: Everything—hiring, training programs, supervisory and management\nresponsibilities, analyst activities, quality standards, workforce planning, you name it—is based\non agent group structure. But as agent group requirements evolve, those supporting functions can\nbecome outdated. This is an issue that requires regular review.

    "text": "Job Roles—Emerging, Evolving\nAn important part of developing an effective organization is to identify the positions you’ll\nneed and the responsibilities that will go along with each. The table below provides a look at\nhow job titles and responsibilities can be defined in a larger contact center.\nLarge centers tend to have more specialized roles and illustrate how responsibilities can\nbecome more specific. Smaller centers often combine some (or many) areas of responsibility\nwhen creating positions. In some of the smallest centers, the manager may wear most every hat\n—including acting as an agent at least part of the time.\nA glance through these roles and responsibilities underscores an important trend: from\nsupervisors on up, management-level job roles are becoming increasingly specialized. Consider\nworkforce management, and the emergence of forecasting, scheduling, and real-time\nmanagement expertise. Similarly, quality initiatives depend on observation and coaching,\nprogram design, calibration, and data analysis. Technology can also lead to specialization, such\nas specific positions dedicated to managing or supporting speech or IVR, desktops, analytics,\nnetworks, quality observation systems, social media tools, or workforce optimization. (If you\nmanage or support a small center, you may still take on many of these responsibilities.)\nInterestingly, at the agent level, job requirements are becoming more generalized. Agents\nmust increasingly understand the access channels customers use, the interrelated nature of\nservices the organization provides, and the scope of customers’ needs and expectations."

For example, agent groups handling\ncomplex financial or insurance issues tend to be on the low end of that range (with more\nsupervisors managing fewer agents), while retail companies and reservations centers tend to be\non the higher end. Technical support centers can have as few as five staff per supervisor. Even\nwithin an industry, there can be a wide variance (one well-known retail company has several\ndozen agents per supervisor—not a number I recommend—while another has 10).\nBe careful about drawing quick conclusions based on these figures or industry benchmarks.\nThere are no simple answers along the lines of, “If you are a such-and-such type of contact\ncenter, you ought to have X staff per supervisor.”\nSome of today’s trends are working to drive the span of control up, including:\nGROWING WORKLOADS. In some sectors, contact center workloads have consistently\nincreased. In those centers that struggle to keep up with growth, the span of control tends to\nincrease.\nBUDGET CONSTRAINTS. As organizations go through restructurings and/or budget\ncutbacks, they often must reduce the relative number of supervisors, which increases spans of\ncontrol. Many senior managers admit that a downward adjustment of span of control would be\nideal but say that funds are simply not available for more supervisor/manager positions.\nGROWTH OF TEAMS. A positive development has been the growth of team-based\nenvironments, which has challenged the traditional role of supervisors. Contact centers have\nlargely moved toward organizations that are flatter and more team-oriented. In many cases, team\nleaders are assuming functions that traditionally have been the domain of managers and\nsupervisors.\nLOWER TURNOVER. Another positive development is that a growing number of centers\nare directly and successfully reducing turnover. As the average experience level of agents moves\nupward, less supervision is generally required.\nConversely, there are other developments in today’s environment that tend to drive span of\ncontrol down, including:\nTHE GROWING COMPLEXITY OF CONTACTS. As better technologies offload\nroutine contacts, and as new contact channels open up and expand, agents are handling\ninteractions that require more human savvy and know-how. The growing complexity of the work\ntends to necessitate more coaching and feedback delivered by supervisors and managers.\nMORE OBSERVATION AND COACHING.

    "text": "organizations maintain a minimum number of supervisors, even during off-hour shifts that\nrequire proportionally fewer agents. MORE SMALL CONTACT CENTERS. This may be the biggest reason that the average\nspan of control across the industry has moved down—there are simply more small groups. For\nexample, if a new contact center has only seven or eight agents, it will likely have a supervisor\neven though that person will be able to supervise more people as the center grows. There are other factors that can confuse the span-of-control issue. For example, team\nstructures vary widely from one organization to the next. Some utilize “lead agents” (team\nleaders) who provide support and guidance to agents while also handling contacts (this can lead\nto an increased span of control). In other organizations, supervisors are highly involved in\nstrategic management responsibilities, which leads to a lower span of control. Additionally, the\ntime that supervisors spend observing and coaching (generally the most time-consuming activity\nbeyond handling contacts) can vary greatly. And many organizations have set up support teams\nto field inquiries from agents who need technology-related help—a responsibility previously\nhandled by supervisors. Recommendations in business literature vary from “train them, empower them, and get out of\nthe way” on one end of the spectrum, to a more structured approach on the other. In their classic\nbook, Executive Leadership, authors Elliot Jacques and Stephen D. Clement mince no words:\n“There is more nonsense centering around the topic of span of control than around nearly any\nother subject in the whole field of organization and management.” They go on to criticize\nmanagers who search for “easy-to-apply rules of thumb that need no thought.”\nThis is applicable to the contact center environment, as well. While somewhere between 8\nand 12 agents per supervisor makes sense in many centers, a 5:1 or 20:1 ratio may be equally\njustifiable. I always get great insight when I ask agents themselves: Are you getting the support\nyou need? What ratio would make sense for you and others who are part of the team? Supervisor-to-Manager Ratios\nAs to supervisor-to-manager spans of control, ratios of between 5:1 and 12:1 are typical. Given the higher-level and more complex interactions that must take place between managers\nand supervisors, spans of control are usually smaller than those between agents and supervisors. This underscores a principle generally true in most organizations: the higher up in the\norganization, the smaller the span of control. Establishing Career and Skill Paths\nThere are two general options for formal employee advancement: career paths and skill\npaths. A typical career path model requires the development of job families, which comprise a\nnumber of jobs arranged in a hierarchy by grade, pay, and responsibility (e.g., agent, team leader,\nsupervisor, manager, senior manager, and director)."

    "text": "Because the historical corporate ladder approach to staff development can be limited for\ncontact centers (due to the finite number of supervisory and management positions available), a\nmore effective approach may be the skill path model. Skill paths focus on an individual’s\nacquisition of skill sets. Individuals often receive more recognition, responsibility, and\ncompensation as they achieve new skill levels within their position. Contact centers, perhaps more than any other part of the organization, require diverse skills. Customer experience, information systems and technologies, queuing theory, forecasting,\nstatistics, human resources management, training, written and verbal communication skills,\nreporting, real-time management and strategy are all components of the environment. Developing attractive career and skill paths is a significant opportunity to recognize the\nknowledge, skills and accomplishments of contact center staff. ✽✽✽\nTHE CLIO PATH\nHappy agents make happy customers. Right? That’s what the team at Clio—which provides practice management software\nfor law firms—believes and lives. “The Clio Path” creates a clear and concise roadmap for development, says David Perry, Clio’s\ncustomer support manager, in an interview published in ICMI Contact Center Insider. “It encourages professional development,\nproject management, and improvements to departmental procedures.”\nDubbed “The CX Roadmap to Clio Success and Beyond,” all new employees work with their supervisors to complete a\ndetailed (11-page!) career roadmap worksheet. Employees are instructed to work at their own pace, and to take ownership of the\naction items that result. There are five steps to the process:\nStep one involves self-discovery assessments. Employees are asked to map out where their career has taken them so far, to\nevaluate the highs and lows, and to consider their aspirations. Step two is refinement, intended to help employees narrow down their development goals. During this stage of the program,\nthey’re encouraged to meet with colleagues in other departments and learn more about their day-to-day responsibilities. They’re\nasked to meet with potential mentors outside the organization, and to write down skills and resources they’ll need to advance in\ntheir career. Step three is exploratory, documenting key takeaways and goals. Step four requires employees to set their own personal development goals and tie them to deadlines and KPIs. For example:\n“By 2021, I’d like to be a thought leader in the customer experience space.” Steps/KPIs:\n▪ Speak at one customer experience conference by mid-year 2020\n▪ Complete online CX certification course by the end of 2020\n▪ Contribute four thought leadership articles to industry publication by the end of 2020\nStep five is execution. Team members identify an accountability buddy and share their goals and next steps. Throughout the\nprocess, employees meet regularly with their buddies to discuss any problems and receive candid feedback."

Referrals spread rapidly, reviews were positive, and before long, the waits to get in\nbecame longer. To customers, this was just confirmation the restaurant was a great choice. But\nover time, the food became less predictable, the service less consistent. They became\ncomplacent. And the word of mouth that was working for them began to work against them. In\nless than two years, they were out of business.\nCan this same complacency happen in contact centers? Of course—but you can avoid it and\ninstead build a culture that is fun, focused, and passionate about the customer experience. What\ndo organizations with the most customer-focused cultures have in common? Here are some traits\nthat really stand out:\nTHEY ESTABLISH A UNIFYING VISION. As discussed throughout the book, a vision\nand supporting strategy that pulls everyone together is critical (see Chapter 2). In The Service\nCulture Handbook, Jeff Toister states it well: “A customer service vision is the cornerstone of a\ncustomer-focused culture. It acts as a compass to get every employee pointed in the same\ndirection.”\nTHEY HIRE THE RIGHT PEOPLE. I had a successful customer service leader put their\napproach to me this way: “We hire the passion and train the skills.” I agree with this approach—\nwhile it makes sense (when possible) to recruit employees who have the skills you need, a drive\nand passion to help customers is a must-have in contact centers.\nTHEY PUT THEIR EMPLOYEES FIRST. Southwest Airlines, one of the world’s most\nadmired companies, states on their website that “In our ‘order of importance,’ we put our\nEmployees first, then our Customers, then our Shareholders … We believe that, if we treat our\nEmployees right, they will treat our Customers right, and in turn that results in increased\nbusiness and profits that make everyone happy.” They also empower employees to make real-\ntime decisions (see discussion in Chapter 11). You can’t expect them to be effective unless they\nhave the authority and means to help customers.\nTHEY COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY. Effective leaders at all levels, whether CEOs\nor supervisors of a group, keep their teams in the know. Good or bad, nobody is second-guessing\nor wondering. Effective leaders listen, intently and often. And they celebrate successes along the\nway.\nTHEY KEEP THE FOCUS ON CUSTOMERS RATHER THAN INTERNAL\nOBJECTIVES. A large cable company with a mixed reputation for service (that they are\nworking hard to change) recently took the symbolic step of putting an empty chair in every"

    "text": "planning meeting, to represent the customer. Those involved say it really means something to\nhave a tangible picture of a customer sitting in those discussions. It’s beginning to have an\nimpact. (A utility goes even further—they bring in customers to talk to new customer service\nagents, and tell them things they like and things they would change about their experiences.)\nTHEY ESTABLISH GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT SUPPORT A CUSTOMER-\nFOCUSED CULTURE. Here’s a non-contact center example I witnessed recently. A chain of\nhardware stores that set “the number of customers served” as a key performance factor realized\nthey were missing opportunities. As they learned, the employee who points to the aisle where the\nwrenches are is not nearly as effective as one who walks the customer to the aisle, asks whether\nthey have an Allen wrench to install the part they requested and, in the process, discovers that the\nproject is part of a larger remodel. With a renewed focus on customers (and retooled\nperformance metrics), this chain is seeing both customer satisfaction and business returns\nimprove. Let’s look at some additional aspects of building customer-focused cultures—ones that also\ninclude the broader organization. Your Organization’s Personality\nMotorcycle company Harley Davidson has incredibly loyal customers. Riders join clubs and\nwear Harley clothes, and some even have Harley tattoos. Many CEOs and chief marketing\nofficers point to Harley as the holy grail of customer loyalty, and wonder what they can do to be\nmore like Harley. The answer: don’t be more like Harley. Be more like you. Connect with your customers in\nyour own way to build excitement that is unique to your brand. Here are two examples. ▪ Northwestern Mutual, the U.S.-based financial services company founded well over a\ncentury ago, has built a reputation for stability. Their customer service is professional and\neffective. “Thank you, Mr. Cleveland. Enjoy the rest of your day.”\n▪ MOO is a fast-growing London-based design and printing company. They encourage their\nteam to (in their words) be passionate, lovely and ambitious. Their approach, like the company\nname, is more playful: “Have an awesome day, Brad!”\nIn both cases, these companies’ unique personalities shine through—and it would create very\nodd customer experiences to swap their styles of service! I’m sometimes baffled to hear plodding phone menus (the monotone “press one for customer\nservice”). And I don’t get service policies that are immediately overridden when customers plead\ntheir case to managers. It doesn’t have to be that way. Those are not best practices. I recently stayed at a resort hotel with my family on a short weekend break. We arrived on a\nhot Saturday evening, and my engine light came on as we pulled into the entry area. I mentioned\nthe light to the parking attendant and he replied, rather brusquely, “If you have car trouble you\nneed to move."

She was visibly embarrassed, saying, “That’s\nnot our brand.” Her concern in those few words was genuine and heartfelt, and I have a feeling\nthey’ll reshape the coaching and support they give their employees, to ensure their brand’s\npersonality shines through from the very first hello.\nCustomer Advocacy\nCustomer advocacy is a hot topic in marketing and customer service circles, and for good\nreason. It can be a powerful part of building a strong brand and creating great business results.\nBut what is it and how do you tap into it?\nIf you do a search for customer advocacy, you’ll find two very different definitions. One is\nan internal perspective: focusing the organization on doing what’s best for customers, creating\ngreat experiences. The other is external: customers advocate for us, spreading the word about our\nproducts, services, and brand.\nWhich is correct? Both! Well, both are half correct. Let’s put them together. We can define\ncustomer advocacy this way: “Customer Advocacy consists of the actions we take to focus the\norganization on doing what is best for customers, which, in turn, rewards us with loyal customers\nwho advocate for our products and brand.”\nCustomer advocacy can play out in small and big ways:\n▪ It can help guide individual interactions. The reservation agent mentions to the customer\nthat an earlier flight would save them $175.\n▪ It can be the catalyst to more involved decisions, such as keeping your contact center open\non weekends to match customer preferences.\n▪ And it can be the driver of dramatic change. When the late Steve Jobs returned to Apple and\nrevived its sagging revenues, he eliminated some products in which the company had invested\nheavily and focused on others that were aligned with customer needs. He said, “You’ve got to\nstart with the customer experience and work back toward the technology—not the other way\naround.” That is customer advocacy at work.\nCustomers are advocates when they positively promote your products and brand. Brand\nadvocates, as they are often called, bring much value to the organization. A McKinsey study\nfound that word of mouth drives 20–50% of all purchase decisions. And according to Bain &\nCompany, customer advocates spend two times more than other customers, and because they\nstay longer, have a customer lifetime value five times greater.\nTurning customers into brand advocates requires adherence to solid principles. The first and\nmost important: don’t forget the real reason you have loyal customers in the first place. Solve\nproblems for them and serve them well through great products and customer-focused service.\nEnsuring that this happens should be a key focus of customer service leadership.\nSecond, make sure your contact center is in the game—that it’s interacting with customers\n“where they are.” A colleague who recently shopped online for a blender found the choices"

Many of those same customers later posted very positive updates. She went with the brand that\nwas engaged. Third, involve the rest of the organization. Here’s an example: UL, a large company\nproviding safety testing and certification services, got inspired to capture on-the-fly feedback\ntheir employees were hearing from customers every day. They created a simple feedback form\ninside their CRM system. The link can be accessed quickly by any employee at any time. They\ncan easily pull up the form from a mobile device and enter the customer’s feedback in real time. Nate Brown, who spearheaded the effort, says, “This has been a complete game changer in how\nwell we understand our customers.” UL also has a robust process for analyzing and acting on\nfeedback captured. Employees in any department love having a dedicated channel for customer feedback—if it’s\neasy to use. And in challenging situations, they can confidently tell customers, “I appreciate your\nfeedback, and I will pass this on to our team.” A main takeaway that UL and others have learned:\ntrue omnichannel goes beyond just integrating channels in the contract center. It involves an\norganization-wide focus on customer experience, facilitated by governance that supports\nseamless and consistent service. True omnichannel goes beyond just integrating channels in the contract center. It\ninvolves an organization-wide focus on customer experience, facilitated by governance that\nsupports seamless and consistent service. Fourth, encourage customers to write reviews. I bought a new pair of sports headphones\nrecently, and received an email from the company founder. “We’re passionate about providing\ngreat products and service,” he said. It included the company’s contact information (access to the\ncontact center) and encouragement to reach out with any question or issue. “Oh, and if you like\nyour new sports headphones, would you be willing to provide a testimonial?” It was genuine and\neffective. Finally, for your most active brand advocates, consider a more involved level of engagement,\nsuch as VIP, loyalty, or inner circle programs. Recognize them, engage with them, and make\nthem your “eyes and ears” for new ideas and innovation opportunities. LEGO engages with its\ncustomers through design contests, robotics challenges, and fun stories on Facebook and other\nsites that introduce new products. (For some additional compelling examples, go to YouTube\nand search for Red Bull, GoPro, or Patagonia to see how they engage with biking, surfing, and\nother sports communities, earning tens of millions of views.)\nConnecting and engaging with advocates is a strategic decision. It involves your contact\ncenter but also focuses the rest of the organization on your customers."

Whether the wins are big or small, celebration has several significant\nbenefits for your organization:\n▪ It leads to a “mindset of success.” Acknowledging the achievement of even small\nmilestones puts success front and center, making it both familiar and a foundation to build on.\n▪ It opens up the big picture. When you celebrate your team’s achievements, it gives you an\nopportunity to talk about how your project or initiative contributes to the organization’s overall\nsuccess (how you’re helping to achieve a broader mission).\n▪ It’s a motivator.

It’s dead wrong to assume you have to achieve a large goal\nin order to celebrate.\n▪ And of course, “There’s not enough time.” But there’s always enough time to do the things\nthat matter most.

Those who work in different places and/or at different times often have trouble seeing themselves as an integral\npart of a larger team. Like leadership in general, there’s no specific recipe for building a cohesive virtual team. However, there are tried-and-true\nsteps you can take that will significantly increase your chances for success:\n▪ Create a clear vision for the contact center. ▪ Create opportunities for the people in the distributed environment to get to know each other. (For example, I know of a\nmanager who set up an internal webpage profiling the members of a multi-site team, occasionally giving everyone a short quiz on\nthe interests and backgrounds of fellow members. Others are tapping into video-based meetings, internal social communities, and\nother approaches to bring people together.)\n▪ Look for ways to keep everyone involved. Time must be spent (even if it’s in short supply) to foster a collaborative\nenvironment. ▪ Take steps to ensure that everyone gets key information at the same time. ▪ Spend proportionately more time tending to the needs and relationships of the more “distant” members of the group. (Distant may mean the members who work the night shift, work primarily at home, or are in a site thousands of miles away.)\n▪ Look for ways to scrap (or at least minimize) the impact of unnecessary hierarchies and cumbersome bureaucracies, which\ntend to wreak havoc on distributed teams. ▪ Consistently communicate and celebrate progress. It’s important to keep the group updated and on the same track. The challenges of leading a distributed team are real and ongoing, but being part of an environment in which people\nsuccessfully work together across distance and time is one of the most rewarding professional experiences you can have. In\ntoday’s world, it’s also one of the most necessary. ✽✽✽\nThe Highest Level of Leadership\nFor several years, I facilitated workshops for new managers of a financial services company. The training occurred annually, over the course of a week. This gave me a view into the\norganization that was like time lapse photography. The VP of customer service in the early years\nwas charismatic, with a big personality. The organization produced good results, and he was\nhighly regarded as an effective leader. When he left for another opportunity, the organization lost\nits way and struggled for many months. Another VP came onboard. Eventually, however, the new VP found her footing. She had a quiet, very understated\nleadership style, but I could see strength in the organization began to return. She, too, eventually\nmoved to a different position, but the organization’s successes continued. The first VP was an\neffective leader. He set clear goals, created an engaged environment, and enabled the team to\nachieve high levels of performance."

Collins’s framework provides insight into the\nprogression of leaders:\n▪ Level 1 is a capable individual, who contributes talent, knowledge, skills, and good work\nhabits.\n▪ Level 2 is a contributing team member who works well with others to produce results.\n▪ Level 3 is a competent manager who can organize employees and resources, to attain\nresults.\n▪ Level 4 is an effective leader who catalyzes commitment to a vision and rallies support to\nachieve high levels of performance.\n▪ Level 5 is the leader who possesses the combination of humility and a ferocious will for the\norganization to be remarkable. Their focus is on leaving the organization stronger and ensuring\nthat it can sustain success.\nCollins and his team refer to the mirror and window to differentiate behavior between level 4\nand level 5 leaders. Level 5 leaders look out the window to credit others for success, and look in\nthe mirror to take responsibility when things don’t go as planned. Charismatic leaders who\nhaven’t reached level 5 tend to do just the opposite: they look out the window to find reasons for\nfailure and look in the mirror to take credit when things go well.\nIf your team falls apart when you’re not available, there’s probably opportunity to clarify\nresponsibilities, further empower your employees, and improve processes, tools, and training to\nreduce dependencies. Can you go on vacation without checking in? That’s a sign that you’ve\nprobably built a team or an organization that’s working. (And you deserve that vacation!)\nCollins observed, “Greatness is not a matter of circumstance—it is a matter of choice and\ndiscipline.” I agree, and I find it encouraging and inspiring.

What’s the legacy you will leave?\n✽✽✽\nPoints to Remember\n‣ Your organizational structure should be unique and fit your specific environment.

If they like it, they feel like\nthey got the gist, the key take-aways. If they don’t like it…well, no big loss, they avoided\nwasting time.\nHow do I know this? All too often, I’m one of them. I love checklists, summaries, bullet\npoints. Please just get to the point, I’ll often be thinking to myself in courses, plodding through\nreports, or reading business books that sometimes drone on. So the logic of jumping to the last\nchapter appeals to me.\nBut here’s the thing. There are no shortcuts to providing consistently great service. There is\nno “executive summary” that will equip you to understand and build an effective contact center. I\nwish there were. In fact, I contemplated providing an appendix for this edition with detailed\nsummaries of what is covered in each chapter—one page each. In the end, I decided that would\nbe a disservice.\nWhy? Consider a comparison to customer service. Just think about how annoyed you are\nwhen you need help and the customer service agent can only relay basic talking points. You want\nto engage in a conversation with a real person—someone who understands more deeply, and\nwho is truly empowered to help.\nSure, you can go through the book as you choose, in an order and at a speed that makes sense\nfor you—with (hopefully) highlighter or pen in hand. Your highlights and notes become the\nsummary. But it’s your summary. That’s different and far better than me trying to create one for\nyou.\nYour organization, team and customers are unique. There’s no one-size-fits-all recipe for\nbuilding and managing a truly effective contact center. That’s a main reason for this book—to\ngive you the deeper information you need to make decisions that are right for your situation.\nThat caution in mind, this last chapter reviews everything we’ve covered. What sets the best\ncontact centers apart? If you have to boil it all down, what traits stand out?\nIn some organizations, you feel the energy as soon as you walk in the door. It takes many\nforms: a strong sense of purpose, camaraderie, and the willingness to make the extra effort.\nEverybody knows the mission and everybody is pulling in the same direction.

They are all still here—we’ve just simplified and\nconsolidated them into seven.)\n1. They Deliver Significant Value\nThe most effective contact centers have a relentless focus on creating value for their\norganizations and customers. Far too many organizations are focused primarily on one level or\none dimension of value: deliver to deliver services efficiently, improve revenues, or boost\ncustomer satisfaction, and so on. While those are good goals, the best organizations have their\nsights set higher. They align their resources, strategy, and culture to deliver maximum value on\nall three levels (see Chapters 1 and 13): efficiency, customer loyalty, and strategic value.\nSome centers I’ve worked with are referred to as \"R&D Machines\" by their organizations\n(R&D as in research and development) because of the insight they capture during interactions,\nshare with other departments, and use to continually create better products and services. After\nall:\n▪ It’s the contact center that first sees early warning signs of product or service glitches.\n▪ It’s the contact center that best knows how well you keep your promises to customers.\n▪ It’s the contact center that knows firsthand when communication is unclear or where\nsystems don’t work as intended.\n▪ And it’s those in the contact center who can so clearly see where there are opportunities to\ninnovate and better meet customer needs."

What really happens when\ncustomers can access the services they need, seamlessly and easily? What is the impact on their\neconomic situation? Their peace of mind? Their families?\nAfter facing enormous challenges and tragedy, GM is now engaging with customers across\nchannels (see Chapters 10 and 15). Customer service has become an engine of quality\nimprovement, innovation, and brand advocacy. I’ve seen scores of other organizations similarly\ndiscover the true potential of their contact centers.\n2. They Build a Customer-Focused Culture\nCulture tends to guide behavior, and it can either support or ruin the best-laid plans. While\nthere is no guaranteed formula for creating a supporting culture, many experienced managers\nagree that shaping culture—or, more correctly, enabling it to flourish—is an important leadership\nresponsibility.\nOne of the most critical aspects of managing a successful contact center is to provide services\nthat satisfy changing consumer demands. Those that fall behind pay a steep price: dissatisfied\ncustomers, insufficient support from the organization and low morale. But those who stay ahead\nof the curve enjoy strong customer loyalty and the many benefits that come with it. The stakes\nare high.\nMost organizations have discovered firsthand a basic reality of customer psychology. When"

    "text": "you improve your service, customers rather quickly progress through four distinct stages:\n▪ They appreciate it.\n▪ They get used to it.\n▪ They expect it.\n▪ They demand it.\nConsequently, continually improving services to meet evolving customer expectations is a\nmandate in today’s environment. In leading contact centers, the ten customer expectations (see\nChapter 2) are an important part of the organization’s development and culture. The list is\nsometimes prominently posted or even memorized by employees, and works its way into\neverything from strategy to process design to day-to-day planning and coaching activities.\nIn short, the best-managed centers have a relentless focus on customers’ ever-evolving needs\nand expectations. They know that what worked yesterday will not necessarily work tomorrow.\nThey are continually redefining plans and reshaping services around those expectations.\nHow else do leading contact centers create high-performance cultures? How do they\ncommunicate their mission and values in a way that gets buy-in and alignment? There are\nnotable characteristics that stand out:\n▪ They have a compelling vision that gets everyone on the same page.\n▪ They have—and use—an up-to-date customer access strategy, which ensures that everyone\nis pulling in the same direction (see Chapter 2).\n▪ They ensure that everyone across the contact center and larger organization has an\nunderstanding of their contribution to the organization and its customers (see the first\ncharacteristic).\n▪ They have a people-first perspective (see the next characteristic).\n▪ They cultivate a collaborative planning process so that their operations run smoothly,\nenabling them to focus on higher-level issues that matter most.\n▪ They get needed budget and support from their organizations (Chapters 10 and 16).\nMichael O’Leary, CEO of no-frills Ryanair, says he learned the importance of customer\nservice the hard way. He once dismissed it, “We don’t want to hear sob stories. What part of ‘no\nrefund’ don’t you understand?” That was until he faced huge operating losses and Ryanair was\nnamed by one source as the second-worst brand in the world. After a change in perspective and\nmany improvements to service, O’Leary later looked back and said, “If I had known being nicer\nto our customers was going to work so well, I would have done it years ago.”\n3.

    "text": "Cultures vary dramatically from one organization to the next. Harley Davidson, MOO, and\nClio have very different cultures (see Chapters 2 and 16). Their organizations’ unique\npersonalities shine through—and swapping their styles of service would create very odd\ncustomer experiences. But in each case, a people-first philosophy is evident.\nSouthwest Airlines, consistently one of the world’s most admired companies, explains their\napproach this way: “In our ‘order of importance,’ we put our employees first, then our\ncustomers, then our shareholders. Many companies feel you have to appease the customers or\nshareholders first … We believe that, if we treat our employees right, they will treat our\ncustomers right, and in turn that results in increased business and profits that make everyone\nhappy.”\nThe most important implication of the trends discussed throughout the book, and particularly\nin Part Four and Five, is clear: your people are the key to success.\n4. They Cultivate Effective Processes\nDiscussing processes can sometimes make eyes glaze over. But effective processes are\nessential, and their value cannot be overstated. The most effective contact centers view processes\nholistically and strategically, and several themes stand out:\nThey view the contact center as a total process. The reality is that the contact center is an\nimportant part of a much bigger process. That has been a theme throughout the book, and it takes\nmany forms:\n▪ Ensure that everyone in the contact center, and those with key supporting roles outside the\ncenter, have a basic understanding of how contact centers operate (encourage them to read\nChapters 9 and 10!).\n▪ Recognize that the process is where most quality problems occur—and also where the\nopportunities for service improvements and cost reductions exist (Chapter 13).\n▪ Take the initiative in coordinating with other departments (Chapters 13 and 16).\n▪ Empower your employees to respond to changing conditions, and give them the authority to\nresolve issues in real time (Chapter 11).\nWithout exception, they have a collaborative planning process. Effective planning is a central\ntheme in Parts Two and Three of this book. A major objective of good planning is to get the right\nnumber of skilled people and supporting resources in place at the right times, doing the right\nthings.\nBut systematic planning accomplishes more than that. It also improves communication and\nculture by creating a body of information that wouldn’t otherwise be available, compels people\nto look into the future and see their work in the context of a larger framework, and encourages\ncommunication about values—issues such as resource allocations and workload priorities.\nLargely due to effective planning, great contact centers work so well that they are almost"

The teams concentrate on delivering the organization’s services and on building the\norganization’s value and brand—the effective operation of the contact center becomes a given.\nThese effective contact centers also establish and focus on the right metrics. As discussed in\nChapters 12 through 14, metrics are plentiful and it’s easy to get buried in information—or\nworse, focus on the wrong things. The contact centers that get the best results from using their\nreports and information have several things in common:\n▪ They focus on a relatively small number of metrics and objectives that support their mission\nand direction. They know that trying to focus on too many things is counterproductive.\n▪ They ensure that measurements are as accurate, complete, and unbiased as possible. They\nare aware of how easily statistics can be misinterpreted. They view reports in light of how they\nrelate to each other. They know that a single report, outside the context of the others, can lead to\nerroneous conclusions.\n▪ They understand that simply tracking high-level measurements won’t improve results.\nInstead, they work on the root causes—the factors behind these outputs.\nZappos CEO Tony Hsieh is so adamant that employees focus on building relationships and\nmaking emotional connections (rather than making sales), that he has held “longest call”\ncontests. One record-breaking call exceeded ten hours!\nAre long interactions the point? Of course not. And do long interactions equate to better\nconnection? Not necessarily. But Zappos, an online retailer in a price-sensitive sector, has\nconcluded that they don’t want upselling or revenue as their primary goal for individual\ninteractions. They want to build relationships and then see good things follow.\n5. They Effectively Leverage Technology\nAs discussed in Chapter 15, new technologies are not passive—they are changing customer\nexpectations, creating power shifts in organizations, and impacting the responsibilities of agents\nand managers. The best contact centers identify the technologies that further the mission of the\norganization, and they implement them with foresight, planning, and training.\nThey also recognize that an important (according to the late Peter Drucker, the most\nimportant) impact of technology is not the capabilities of the technologies themselves, but that\nthey require you to organize your processes and information more logically. The most effective\ncontact centers have systems that are supported by processes designed to ensure information on\ncustomers, products, processes, and services is current and accurate.\nFor example:\n▪ Their knowledge management systems work because they make entering and updating\nknowledge a priority at the point of contact.\n▪ Their quality monitoring systems are valuable because they have clearly defined quality and\nwhat needs to happen to support the organizations’ highest-level objectives."

Some have the latest\ncapabilities; others don’t—but they use what they have to support their mission and most\nimportant objectives.\n6. They Get the Budget and Support They Need\nFar too many contact centers are operating under the philosophy of, “Okay, these are the\nresources we’re willing to give you, and this is what we want you to achieve …” That’s putting\nthe cart before the horse.\nHere’s an analogy. Airlines couldn’t possibly operate a flight without a tangible connection\nbetween the results they want to achieve and the supporting resources they need. They start with\nan objective—fly 300 people from Frankfurt to Dubai. The objective is not a wishful goal, but a\nspecific predetermined outcome supported by carefully calculated resources.\nSimilarly, the best contact centers first decide on the objectives they want to achieve. Then\nthey allocate the resources necessary to support those objectives, through informed calculations\nand disciplined planning (as discussed in Chapters 4 through 10). Support also very much\ndepends on building customer-focused organizations (see Chapter 16). They encourage\ncollaboration, harness the principles of effective organizational structure, and continually work\non identifying the positions they need and the responsibilities that go along with them. They\nfocus on what matters and they celebrate successes along the way.\nSarah Gibart is Education and Quality Supervisor for Gopher Sport, a leading supplier of\nphysical education, athletics, and fitness products. She and several of her colleagues recently\nwon awards from ICMI for the innovative work they are doing in the contact center. Gibart\nrecalls her journey over the past 12 years: “I had no contact center experience before walking in\nthe door.” She credits mentors “who were there for me the whole way. That is what I\nexperienced from the very beginning and I really wanted to give that back and watch people\ngrow and be successful.”\nBravo, Sarah! This principle (core value) of helping others succeed is one I’ve repeatedly\nseen in the most successful organizations.\n7. They Continuously Innovate\nApple founder Steve Jobs once commented: “I think Henry Ford once said, ‘If I’d asked\ncustomers what they wanted, they would have told me: a faster horse!’” Whether Ford actually\nsaid that is disputed, but he (and Jobs) certainly lived by the underlying principle: people don’t"

They agree with the advice of\nmanagement consultant Dr. Ichak Adizes, who reminds us, “You don’t know what you don’t\nknow until you know it … The right solution is a continuous search for the right solution.”\nWhere to from Here?\nThe contact center profession has come a long way in recent years.

More than ever, organizations need professionals\nwho can help them sort through these changes and make sound business decisions. By virtually\nany measure, there’s a shortage of leaders who really understand the unique contact center\nenvironment and how to deliver great business results.\nClearly, contact centers are becoming increasingly complex to operate, and that trend will\ncontinue.
