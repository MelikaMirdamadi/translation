For example, there\nwas a time when being accessible simply meant having a call center, a toll-free number, and\nreasonably well-trained agents. Today, there are many access alternatives, and customers expect\nto reach you easily and intuitively (they don’t want to think about channels). Customers expect\nservice that is easy to use and consistent across all touchpoints."
  },
  {
    "page": 28,
    "paragraph": "While courtesy used to refer primarily to the way agents interact with customers, the\ndefinition today is much more ingrained in systems and processes. Don’t make customers repeat\nthe same information or reexplain the background of an existing service issue. Don’t transfer\nthem around or place them on hold for too long. And put your contact information where\ncustomers can easily find it. Sure, it’s as important as ever that your agents are courteous—but\nthere’s a lot more to it."

As one example, email\nresponse times have gotten far better in recent years—from several days to a matter of hours in\nmany organizations (see Chapter 4).

Similarly, more organizations all the time are\nhandling time-sensitive social media interactions as they occur."

If you want to differentiate through service, don’t just copy\nindustry “best practices”—be bold and create services that are appropriate for your organization\nand brand.\n▪ Finally, ensure that customer expectations form the context in which you develop your\ncustomer access strategy—the topic we’ll turn to next."

  },
  {
    "page": 45,
    "paragraph": "The third driving force in contact centers is customer tolerance. There are seven factors that\naffect tolerance. They influence how long customers will wait in queue, how many will abandon,\nwhether they will try alternative channels, and how they feel about the overall experience (based\non the expectations they had). They include:\n1. DEGREE OF MOTIVATION. How important is the interaction to customers? What are\nthe consequences to them of not getting through? How badly do they need the product or\nservice? For example, customers experiencing a power outage will usually wait longer to reach\ntheir utility than those with billing questions.\n2. AVAILABILITY OF SUBSTITUTES. Even though they are highly motivated to initiate\na contact, customers who encounter difficulties may abandon if they know of another way to get\nhelp. Self-service, communities found online, or even physically going to a retail location are\nexamples of substitutes. If customers are highly motivated and have no acceptable alternatives,\nthey will generally wait a long time in queue (and will retry if they get busy signals). Even\nthough they do not abandon, they still might be very unhappy about the experience.\n3. COMPETITION’S SERVICE LEVEL. If it’s easier for customers to use competitive\nservices and if they have a tough time reaching you, they may go elsewhere. (You’ll need to\nconsider whether competition is available in a practical sense. For example, if you are a bank and\na customer has a problem with an online payment, a competitive bank is not going to be able to\nhelp—although if the problem is difficult to get resolved, the customer may decide to take their\nfuture business elsewhere.) It’s also important to consider that a contact center is often its own\ncompetition—customers may choose incorrect routing selections in the IVR or simultaneously\ntry other channels just to reach an agent…any agent…more quickly. This leads to transferred\ncontacts, inaccurate reports, longer handling times and other problems.\n4. LEVEL OF EXPECTATIONS. The experiences customers have had with the contact\ncenter and the reputation that the organization has for service have a direct impact on tolerance."

    "page": 45,
    "paragraph": "A 10-minute wait for tax help during filing season may be perceived as good service—but a\nsimilar wait for a shipping company that has a reputation for speedy service would be an\nunpleasant surprise.

How much time do customers have when they initiate a contact?"

In the\nrare cases they don’t, a large percentage of customers will likely have calling plans that provide\nnationwide calling. But there’s a rub: If a customer’s plan is based on blocks of minutes, they\ncan get understandably upset if the time they purchased is wasted in queue. (Virtual queue\ncapabilities can help in this case—see discussion, Can You Eliminate the Wait for Customers?)\n7. HUMAN BEHAVIOR.

So, a call begins with the greeting; chat begins when the agent begins interacting\nwith the customer; a social media contact is “answered” when it reaches the agent and he or she\nbegins replying.

AN ASSUMPTION THAT “THE FORECASTING SOFTWARE KNOWS BEST.” If\nyou have forecasting software or a workforce management system, don’t relinquish decisions to\nthe program, assuming that it knows best.

In fact,\nin the example, you could have 60 agents rush in and handle all 60 interactions just before the\npromised response time and still meet your objective. What you are really doing is looking for an\nefficient way to distribute the workload across your schedules within the promised response\ntime.\n▪ The basic response time formula assumes a “static” amount of work to be completed—in\nother words, you have a defined amount of work that has already arrived and is waiting to be\nprocessed. However, contacts that can be deferred arrive throughout the day in patterns that are\noften similar to service level-type traffic. With 24-hour response time objectives, projected\nworkload can simply be built into the following day’s staffing requirements. But if you have\nmore aggressive response time objectives, you’ll need to look at both on-hand workload and\nprojections by interval to determine staffing requirements.\n▪ When response time objectives are less than an hour, use Erlang C or computer simulation\nto calculate base staff. This would be a queuing and service level scenario, like inbound calls.\n▪ Breaks, absenteeism and other activities that keep agents from the work need to be added to\nbase staff calculations (a step we’ll cover in Chapter 8).\n▪ An “efficiency factor” acknowledges that agents cannot handle one interaction after another\nwith no “breathing” time in between. For example, if you want to build in an efficiency factor\nwith a ceiling of 90 percent, divide base staff calculations by .9 to determine if additional agents\nare required."

Whether these outbound contacts happen during\ncontacts from customers or immediately following the contacts as part of after-call work, they\nshould be considered part of handling time. As such, they should be included in base staff\nrequirements for the inbound workload.\n2. OUTBOUND CONTACTS THAT ARE SCHEDULED. In many cases, outbound\ncontacts to customers or prospects can be scheduled based on factors such as convenience to\ncustomers, highest probability of making successful connections, etc. Within these blocks of\ntime, outbound contacts can be generated and handled one after another. Base staff requirements\ncan be calculated using traditional response time calculations; for example, a minimum of five\nagents would be required to handle 20 hours’ worth of contacts in four hours’ time.

Contacts are stacked up in queue and service level is\nlow.

Here’s how the calculations\nproduced an estimated 37.6 hours on the trunks:\n▪ First, you can see that customers will be queued for agents an average of 13 seconds (ASA)\nand will be connected to agents an average of 180 seconds (average talk time), for a total of 193\nseconds. The 180 seconds represents the forecast for what average talk time will likely be; the 13\nseconds ASA comes from the Erlang C calculation.\n▪ Because the table provides volume for a half hour, double 350 contacts to assume 700\ncontacts in an hour.\n▪ Because the 700 calls spend an average 193 seconds queuing for and connected to agents,\nthe trunk load in seconds is 135,100 seconds (700 contacts × 193 seconds).\n▪ Finally, because trunk load is presented in erlangs (hours of traffic over the course of an\nhour), divide 135,100 by 3,600 (the number of seconds in an hour) and you come up with 37.6\nhours. To use the correct telecom lingo, you’ll have the equivalent of 37.6 erlangs of traffic on\nthe trunks for this agent group during this time period.

Develop good working relationships with the individuals who run\nother areas of the organization. Learn about their goals and objectives and how the contact center\nmight best support their needs.\n▪ Build an understanding of the contact center’s role and potential. Ensure that the prevailing\nperspective is that the role of the center is to serve other parts of the organization, not to point out\nflaws.\n▪ Build a team that is focused on capturing, analyzing, sharing, and using value-added\ninformation across the organization. A suggested ratio is that you need one business analyst for\nevery 30 to 50 agents. The ideal ratio depends on many factors, but will become clearer once you\nget started.\n▪ Ensure that quality at the point of customer contact is given the broadest possible definition\n(e.g., that coaching, quality observation and objectives at the agent level are all considered\nessential elements of these major strategic opportunities).\n▪ Define assumptions and unknowns in reports and data. Ensure that everyone understands\nwhere the data comes from and what definitions are in place. Strategic decisions based on\nmisinterpreted reports can be worse than if there were no reports at all.\n▪ Get the best tools you can. Analytics and performance management systems can help you\nanalyze content, detect trends and causal factors, and identify improvement opportunities. Get\nstarted even if you don’t have these capabilities, but work toward acquiring and building\nsupporting technologies.\n▪ Don’t get overwhelmed. There is a ton of information that you could provide to each\nbusiness unit. Instead of focusing on quantity (by trying to ensure that everything that may be\nvaluable is shared), concentrate on providing the information that is likely to be most useful."

  },
  {
    "page": 272,
    "paragraph": "First, coaching is a relationship, NOT an event. The best coaches build relationships of trust,\nrespect, and accountability. They help clarify goals, serve as role models, and provide positive\nreinforcement."
  },
  {
    "page": 272,
    "paragraph": "Second, coaching has far more impact when it’s supported by clear quality standards. Your\nstandards should be understood and interpreted consistently. And this works in both directions;\nquality standards guide coaching, and coaching, in turn, helps your employees consistently\ndeliver services that reflect your standards."
  },
  {
    "page": 272,
    "paragraph": "Third, all of your coaches should use a proven coaching model. There are many to choose\nfrom. As one example, ICMI recommends a simple framework that can be remembered by the\nletters SAFE:\n▪ Summarize observed behavior in the context of quality standards.\n▪ Ask the employee for their input on how things went.\n▪ Formulate a plan with them for addressing performance gaps and opportunities.\n▪ Express thanks for their time and input."
  },
  {
    "page": 273,
    "paragraph": "There’s the risk that any approach can be formulaic, so your coaches will want to convey\nthese things with their own style and personality. But whether you use this model or another, it’s\nessential that there’s agreement on what will be coached."
  },
  {
    "page": 273,
    "paragraph": "Fourth, effective coaching focuses on the toughest and most important challenges. For\nexample:\n▪ What does it mean to really listen and understand customers?\n▪ How do you find the best solutions for customer issues?\n▪ How can you turn around tough customers or successfully handle particularly complex\nissues?"
  },
  {
    "page": 273,
    "paragraph": "Organizations that do a great job with these challenges create scenarios and role plays. You\nwon’t be able to anticipate or train on every unique issue that comes along, so your employees\nwill need to know how to make good decisions. That takes practice."
  },
  {
    "page": 273,
    "paragraph": "Finally, approach training, coaching, and performance standards as opportunities to empower\nyour agents to coach themselves. Self-coaching is the talk each person has with himself or\nherself as service is delivered day by day and moment by moment. For self-coaching to be\neffective, each person should have a deep understanding of the organization’s mission, values,\nand quality standards. They must also be empowered to make good, in-the-moment decisions\n(see Chapter 11)."

It’s powerful to have agents come to training with a checklist or summary of goals,\nespecially when they had a part in creating it around an understood and shared set of objectives.\n▪ You reinforce training after it happens. Training can facilitate learning new skills and knowledge, but it won’t stick without\npractice and reinforcement.\n▪ You deliver refresher training as needed. (Example: training new agents on adherence and other performance metrics is\ngreat, but they will need one or more refreshers as they settle in.)\n▪ Training is relevant to the job, the center, the customer and the organization.\n▪ The trainer/facilitator understands the goals and objectives for the training, as well as the target audience.\n▪ The training delivery method matches the need; the method (e.g., formal, informal, online, classroom, elearning, etc.) is\nappropriate for the learning objectives."

After more than a year of enduring storms, sickness and\nfailures on the high seas, the crew of HMS Agamemnon completed running the first transatlantic\ntelegraph cable.

For onlookers, investors, and especially the\ncrew, this was a heartbreaking and bitter end to an immense and bold undertaking. But the\nproject—though viewed as a failure at the time—helped to establish a vision of a more\nconnected world.\n“A plate of silver and one of zinc are taken into the mouth, the one above, the other\nbelow the tongue.

Your best agents really know how to serve customers; watching them work can present\nmany opportunities for developing and improving self-service systems.\n▪ Involve agents in system design. Your agents should actively serve on project teams responsible for building self-service\nsystems. They can also help monitor and test systems and interpret customer behavior and feedback.\n▪ Integrate self-service and contact center systems. Integrated systems can enable agents to use the information captured in\nself-service applications when they are assisting customers.\n▪ Capture customer feedback about self-service systems. This information is essential to improving system design.\n▪ Enable customers to easily reach agents.
